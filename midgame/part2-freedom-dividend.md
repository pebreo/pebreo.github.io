todo : explain dividend and origins from andrew yang

## The Smiths
The delivery app glowed accusingly on the Smiths' kitchen counter. Takeout Tuesdays were a tradition, a refuge from the relentless pressure cooker of life. But tonight, the usual banter between Sandra and Michael was muted.  Sandra, a freelance web developer, had just finished a particularly dry spell. Michael, a mechanic whose skills were increasingly challenged by electric vehicles, stared out the window, his brow furrowed. The specter of financial insecurity hung heavy in the air.

"Imagine," Sandra began, her voice barely a whisper, "a world where a quiet month wouldn't mean scrambling for bills."  Michael turned, a flicker of hope battling the cynicism that had become a familiar companion. 

"A safety net," Sandra continued, the words carrying a newfound weight. "A chance to breathe, to explore new areas, maybe even take that pottery class you've always mentioned." Michael, a man whose hands had always found solace in the tangible, harbored a secret desire – shaping clay into something beautiful. 

The freedom dividend wasn't a novel concept.  Wouldn't it stifle innovation?  Wouldn't people become complacent?  But as Sandra dug deeper, a new perspective emerged.  What if the dividend wasn't a hammock, but a launching pad?  "I could start that pastry business I always to," she thought.

Also, the fear of losing their jobs wouldn't disappear, but the terror of freefall might.  So, takeout debate remained undecided, but a different kind of menu had opened – a menu of possibilities.

## TLDR
Technological changes are coming fast and hard. The freedom dividend can be used to prevent permanent damage. It depends on the person.

**The Freedom Dividend: net, fertilizer, and soil**

What is the Freedom Dividend? It was the 2020 US presidential candidate Andrew Yang's signature proposal during his campaign. It is a universal payment of $1,000 per month to all American adults as a solution to inevitable consequences of dizzying improvements in technology leaving people behind.

In the United States, the five most common jobs are administrtive/clerical work, retail/sales, food service/prep, truck driving/transportation, and manufacturing. Those jobs take up about **half of all** jobs in America. So what?

If you believe robots and AI will become good enough to replave human labor. If you believe that technology will develop faster than people can get go back to school or retrain.  And, if you believe not everyone has the money or time to do that, then the freedom dividend would be a safety net. Let me explain.

Automation and robot labor are coming online and, undoubtedly, a game changer. It will create staggering wealth. It can also leave many in our communities behind - their skillsets no longer needed. This creates a crucial need for a safety net – a system that ensures hard times don't cripple you. The freedom dividend is the solution.

Also, the freedom dividend is like fertilizer and soil. Why?

By providing all citizens with basic needs met with a guaranteed payment, regardless of employment status, the freedom dividend can prevent permanent damage from  unexpected emergencies, hard times, and constant economic stress. It empowers individuals to pursue education, retrain for new jobs, or even start their own businesses. This allows and encourages innovation and entrepreneurship even in the face of technological disruption.
