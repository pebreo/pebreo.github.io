## Section 2 - Playing our cards right

In the last section I defined intelligence, consciousness, whst the blockchain does, polyamory (and ethical non-monogamy), and what it means to upgrade to an antifragile mindset. Last, I describe a way to make AI that it human-sligned, explainable & understandable, and would be affordable to all.

We covered a lot. But even with the pieces in place, we still have to play our cards right. 

Here I present plans to help bridge us to The Endgame. However, these actions must be done first before we reach GOAT World.


## The Human Touch in a Technological Age: Solutions for a Changing World

The relentless march of technology presents both opportunities and challenges. While it automates tasks and improves efficiency, it can also leave some workers behind, leading to unemployment. 

Furthermore, developed countries face a unique set of problems – declining birth rates and rising divorce rates. 

Finally, the high cost of essential resources like housing and farming equipment creates a barrier to entry for many. The challenges are big so we need novel, bold solutions: the freedom dividend, polyamory / ethical non-monogamy, and open-source models.

**The Disruption Dilemma: The Freedom Dividend as another safety net**

Automation is a double-edged sword. While it fuels economic growth, it also displaces workers whose skillsets are no longer needed. This creates a crucial need for a safety net – a system that ensures hard times don't cripple you. The freedom dividend is the solution.

By providing all citizens with basic needs met with a guaranteed payment, regardless of employment status, the freedom dividend can prevent permanent damage from  unexpected emergencies, hard times, and constant economic stress. It empowers individuals to pursue education, retrain for new jobs, or even start their own businesses. This allows and encourages innovation and entrepreneurship even in the face of technological disruption.  

**Rethinking Relationships**

Developed countries face a paradox – declining birth rates coupled with high divorce rates. This raises concerns about a shrinking workforce and a strain on social security systems. While promoting traditional family structures remains important, one approach could be explored: polyamory and ethical non-monogamy.

Although this concept challenges societal norms, it could offer couples a way to address individual needs for intimacy and fulfillment while maintaining a stable family unit. Open relationships, when navigated with honesty and clear communication,  could potentially reduce the emotional and financial toll of divorce, leading to a more stable societal structure. However, the success of this approach hinges on cultural acceptance and responsible implementation. 

**Democratizing Resources: Open Source for Food and Shelter**

The high cost of essential resources like farming equipment, housing materials, and seeds creates a barrier to self-sufficiency for many. Open-source models, currently used in software development, offer a novel solution. By sharing designs and blueprints freely, individuals and communities can manufacture their own tools and shelters at a significantly lower cost. This fosters a collaborative environment where communities can pool resources and knowledge, empowering them to become more self-reliant. Open-source farming equipment, for instance, could revolutionize agriculture in developing countries, making food production more accessible. 

**Conclusion: A Human-Centric Approach**

The solutions presented here are not without their challenges. UBI requires careful economic planning, open relationships necessitate emotional maturity, and open-source models demand technical expertise. However, these unconventional approaches highlight a crucial point – the need for a human-centric approach to solve the problems of the future. By prioritizing human well-being and fostering collaboration, we can navigate the disruptions of technology and create a more equitable and resilient society. Ultimately, the key lies in embracing change while preserving the core values that bind us together. 



## Angela
The phone buzzed on the nightstand, illuminating Angela's face in the soft glow. It was Mark, his message a cascade of words that made her heart skip a beat. "I think we could make it work," he said. They have been looking into polyamory - reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching videos. 

Five years of marriage, a comfortable routine, a well-worn path. But lately, a quiet discontent had settled in. Their careers had taken off in different directions, their friend groups evolved, and shared passions felt like forgotten songs.

Mark, ever the adventurer, was proposing an experiment – a chance to explore new experiences, ones that might not fit into their current mold. It was terrifying, like venturing off a well-worn map into uncharted territory. Yet, a rebellious ember flickered in Angela too. Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't about breaking something, but about making it... antifragile.

Taking a fortifying breath, Angela messaged back, "Ok. Let's talk." Their usual spot, a cozy bookstore cafe, buzzed with the same nervous energy that crackled between them. Mark, anxious and excited, was a jumbled mess of explanations.  Angela countered, a wry smile on her lips, "So, fragile egos are a dealbreaker then?"

Laughter, shaky and laced with tension, filled the air. The conversation flowed, halting at times, but raw with a newfound honesty. They talked about jealousy, boundaries, communication, even couples therapy. They had a lot scary things to say to eachother. It wasn't a done deal, but a step, a leap of faith into the messy, unpredictable world of antifragility.

As they walked out, the city lights twinkling against the twilight sky, Angela felt a lightness she hadn't known existed. The road ahead was uncertain, but the fear was laced with a strange, exhilarating thrill.

## TLDR
Adopting the idea that you can grow from hardship even includes romantic relationships. An antifragile mindset is scary but can be very rewarding.
