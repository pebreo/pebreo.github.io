## Angela
The phone buzzed on the nightstand, illuminating Angela's face in the soft glow. It was Mark, his message a cascade of words that made her heart skip a beat. "I think we could make it work," he said. They have been looking into polyamory - reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching videos. 

Five years of marriage, a comfortable routine, a well-worn path. But lately, a quiet discontent had settled in. Their careers had taken off in different directions, their friend groups evolved, and shared passions felt like forgotten songs.

Mark, ever the adventurer, was proposing an experiment â€“ a chance to explore new experiences, ones that might not fit into their current mold. It was terrifying, like venturing off a well-worn map into uncharted territory. Yet, a rebellious ember flickered in Angela too. Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't about breaking something, but about making it... antifragile.

Taking a fortifying breath, Angela messaged back, "Ok. Let's talk." Their usual spot, a cozy bookstore cafe, buzzed with the same nervous energy that crackled between them. Mark, anxious and excited, was a jumbled mess of explanations.  Angela countered, a wry smile on her lips, "So, fragile egos are a dealbreaker then?"

Laughter, shaky and laced with tension, filled the air. The conversation flowed, halting at times, but raw with a newfound honesty. They talked about jealousy, boundaries, communication, even couples therapy. They had a lot scary things to say to eachother. It wasn't a done deal, but a step, a leap of faith into the messy, unpredictable world of antifragility.

As they walked out, the city lights twinkling against the twilight sky, Angela felt a lightness she hadn't known existed. The road ahead was uncertain, but the fear was laced with a strange, exhilarating thrill.

## TLDR
Adopting the idea that you can grow from hardship even includes romantic relationships. An antifragile mindset is scary but can be very rewarding.
