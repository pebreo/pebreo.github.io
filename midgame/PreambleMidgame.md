#### GOATs crossing a bridge
In the last section I defined intelligence, consciousness, whst the blockchain does, polyamory (and ethical non-monogamy), and what it means to upgrade to an antifragile mindset. Last, I describe a way to make AI that it human-sligned, explainable & understandable, and would be affordable to all.

We covered a lot. But even with the pieces in place, we still have to play our cards right. 

Here I present plans to help bridge us to The Endgame. However, these actions must be done first before we reach GOAT World.


## The Human Touch in a Technological Age: Solutions for a Changing World

The relentless march of technology presents both opportunities and challenges. While it automates tasks and improves efficiency, it can also leave some workers behind, leading to people losing their livelihoods. For some its temporay, for others permanent and devastating. Can you imagine yourself in their situation?

Furthermore, developed countries face a unique set of problems – declining birth rates and rising divorce rates. 

Finally, the high cost of essential resources like housing and farming equipment creates a barrier to entry for many. The challenges are big so we need novel, bold solutions: the freedom dividend, polyamory / ethical non-monogamy (ENM), and open-source models.

**The Freedom Dividend: net, fertilizer, and soil**

The freedom dividend is a safety net. Let me explain.

Automation and robot labor are coming online. It's a game changer. While it will fuel incredible economic growth, it also it leaves many in our communities behind - their skillsets no longer needed. This creates a crucial need for a safety net – a system that ensures hard times don't cripple you. The freedom dividend is the solution.

Also, the freedom dividend is like fertilizer and soil. Why?

By providing all citizens with basic needs met with a guaranteed payment, regardless of employment status, the freedom dividend can prevent permanent damage from  unexpected emergencies, hard times, and constant economic stress. It empowers individuals to pursue education, retrain for new jobs, or even start their own businesses. This allows and encourages innovation and entrepreneurship even in the face of technological disruption. 

**Rethinking Relationships**

Developed countries face a paradox – declining birth rates coupled with high divorce rates. This raises concerns about a shrinking workforce and a strain on social security systems. While promoting traditional family structures remains important, one approach could be explored: polyamory and ethical non-monogamy.

Although polyamory & ENM challenges societal norms, it offer couples a choice and a way to address individual needs for intimacy and fulfillment while maintaining a stable family unit. These open relationships, when navigated with honesty and clear communication, could reduce the costly and very painful wounds of divorce. How many families has this affected? How much temporary and permant damage does it cause? Is it worth looking into? The success of this relationship style being just another option hinges on cultural acceptance and responsible implementation.

**Democratizing Resources: Open Source for Food and Shelter**

The high cost of essential resources like farming equipment, housing materials, and seeds creates a barrier to self-sufficiency for many. Open-source models, currently used in software development, offer a novel solution. By sharing designs and blueprints freely, individuals and communities can manufacture their own tools and shelters at a significantly lower cost. Now, combine this with the inevitable robotic labor and affordable housing, food, and other basic necessities become much more affordable to all.


Also, this fosters a collaborative environment where communities can pool resources and knowledge, empowering them to become more self-reliant. Open-source farming equipment, for instance, would revolutionize agriculture in developing countries, making food production more accessible. 

**Conclusion: A Human-Centric Approach**

The solutions presented here are not without their challenges. UBI requires careful economic planning, open relationships necessitate emotional maturity, and open-source models demand technical expertise. However, these unconventional approaches highlight a crucial point – the need for a human-centric approach to solve the problems of the future. By prioritizing human well-being and fostering collaboration, we can navigate the disruptions of technology and create a more equitable and resilient society. Ultimately, the key lies in embracing change while preserving the core values that bind us together.
