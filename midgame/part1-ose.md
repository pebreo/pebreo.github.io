todo: story about making money from open source

#### GOATs crossing a bridge

## Playing our cards right
In the last section I defined intelligence, consciousness, whst the blockchain does, polyamory (and ethical non-monogamy), and what it means to upgrade to an antifragile mindset. Last, I describe a way to make AI that it human-sligned, explainable & understandable, and would be affordable to all.

We covered a lot. But even with the pieces in place, we still have to play our cards right. 

The relentless march of technology presents both opportunities and challenges. While it automates tasks and improves efficiency, it can also leave people in our communities behind. For some the damage is temporay, for others permanent and devastating. Not everyone has the resources to weather the storm. Can you imagine yourself in their situation?

Furthermore, developed countries face a unique set of problems – declining birth rates and rising divorce rates. 

Finally, the high cost of essential resources like housing and farming equipment creates a barrier to entry for many. The challenges are big so we need novel, bold solutions: the freedom dividend, polyamory / ethical non-monogamy (ENM), and open-source models.

Here I present plans to help bridge us to The Endgame. However, these actions must be done first before we reach GOAT World.



## Marcin
Marcin squinted at the endless rows of wheat, his calloused hand tracing a hesitant line down a stalk. The city life, once a vibrant dream, now felt like a faded photograph compared to the earthy canvas stretching before him. He was a farmer now, a decision fueled by a yearning for simpler things, not a fat bank account.

His pride and joy, a rusty but rumbling tractor named Bertha, chugged along the furrows, leaving behind a trail of freshly turned soil. The joy of seeing life sprout where there was only dust was a balm to his soul. Until, with a sputter and a cough, Bertha lurched to a stop. Panic clawed at Marcin's throat. He had barely scraped together enough to buy the darn thing, let alone repairs.

Days turned into weeks as Marcin nursed Bertha back to health, every penny he’d saved going towards the mechanic. He worked tirelessly by hand, his back aching, sweat stinging his eyes, but the thought of his wife, Elara, and their two young children with empty plates spurred him on.

Just as hope flickered back, a sickening crunch shattered the morning quiet. Bertha, spewing smoke, refused to budge. Despair threatened to engulf Marcin. He stared at the endless fields, the dream turning into a nightmare. How would he feed his family? How could he explain this to Elara, her eyes already etched with worry?

That evening, Elara placed a steaming bowl of stew in front of him. Her smile, though strained, held a strength that mirrored the wheat swaying in the breeze. "We'll figure it out," she said, her voice firm. To be continued...

## TLDR
The status quo is planned obsolence. Bad things can happen and really hurt you. Not everyone can afford the newest, best, or even unexpected repairs.

**Democratizing Resources: Open Source for Food and Shelter**

The high cost of essential resources like farming equipment, housing materials, and seeds creates a barrier to self-sufficiency for many. Open-source models, currently used in software development, offer a novel solution. By sharing designs and blueprints freely, individuals and communities can manufacture their own tools and shelters at a significantly lower cost. Now, combine this with the inevitable robotic labor and affordable housing, food, and other basic necessities become much more affordable to all.


Also, this fosters a collaborative environment where communities can pool resources and knowledge, empowering them to become more self-reliant. Open-source farming equipment, for instance, would revolutionize agriculture in developing countries, making food production more accessible. 


## Why it would work
- open source software already runs our infrastructure
- fusion & ai will be availble to run it
- more eyes to find bugs
- more eyes to make improvements
- in public domain so availbe to modify for specific use
- no incentive build in obsolesence
-
