#### GOATs crossing a bridge

## Playing our cards right
In the last section I defined intelligence, consciousness, whst the blockchain does, polyamory (and ethical non-monogamy), and what it means to upgrade to an antifragile mindset. Last, I describe a way to make AI that it human-sligned, explainable & understandable, and would be affordable to all.

We covered a lot. But even with the pieces in place, we still have to play our cards right. 

The relentless march of technology presents both opportunities and challenges. While it automates tasks and improves efficiency, it can also leave some workers behind, leading to people losing their livelihoods. For some its temporay, for others permanent and devastating. Can you imagine yourself in their situation?

Furthermore, developed countries face a unique set of problems â€“ declining birth rates and rising divorce rates. 

Finally, the high cost of essential resources like housing and farming equipment creates a barrier to entry for many. The challenges are big so we need novel, bold solutions: the freedom dividend, polyamory / ethical non-monogamy (ENM), and open-source models.

Here I present plans to help bridge us to The Endgame. However, these actions must be done first before we reach GOAT World.



**Democratizing Resources: Open Source for Food and Shelter**

The high cost of essential resources like farming equipment, housing materials, and seeds creates a barrier to self-sufficiency for many. Open-source models, currently used in software development, offer a novel solution. By sharing designs and blueprints freely, individuals and communities can manufacture their own tools and shelters at a significantly lower cost. Now, combine this with the inevitable robotic labor and affordable housing, food, and other basic necessities become much more affordable to all.


Also, this fosters a collaborative environment where communities can pool resources and knowledge, empowering them to become more self-reliant. Open-source farming equipment, for instance, would revolutionize agriculture in developing countries, making food production more accessible. 


## Why it would work
- open source software already runs our infrastructure
- fusion & ai will be availble to run it
- more eyes to find bugs
- more eyes to make improvements
- in public domain so availbe to modify for specific use
- no incentive build in obsolesence
- 
## What will happen
