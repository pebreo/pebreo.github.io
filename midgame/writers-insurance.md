Is divorce happening? It ought to stop.

At best, it helps reverse trends of infidelty, divorce, social and moneysry cost of divorces.

At worse, causes romatiic coules to split apart who would split apart anyway.

In my opinion, even if,poly/ENM cant reverse population collapse, it harms nobody and communication skills upgraded

## Wealthy and Famous Divorces

| Name | Industry | Spouse | Year Finalized | Marriages |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bill Gates | Tech | Melinda Gates | 2021 | 1 |
| Rupert Murdoch | Media | Jerry Hall (4th Marriage) | 2022 | 4 |
| Steven Spielberg | Film | Amy Irving | 1989 | 3 |

This tabke is not to pick on any one person, rather to show how prevalent it in The United States.

In my view, the casualness with which celebrity breakups are announced means it is accepted as a cultural norm. The reality remains. For most, divorce is a messy, emotionally fraught experience. Financial anxieties, child custody battles, and the (some) social stigma often associated with divorce are realities.

At the same time, it can downplay the challenges of divorce, particularly for those who lack the financial resources and social support networks readily available to well-to-do.  In my opinion, divorce shouldn't be demonized, but it shouldn't be romanticized either. The consequences can be permantly damaging to many people besides those that are separating.

However, there's a potential upside to this trend. There is an opportinty to upgrade how we see romantic relationships.

## Divorce in the zeitgeist

It's become almost commonplace for wealthy and famous to divorcd. This begs the question: is it representative of the general populous?
