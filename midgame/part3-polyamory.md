## Callum

For the past five years, Callum had thrived in the familiar rhythm of life in this quaint Greek village. The predictable cycle of tending his olive grove, chatting with the gregarious townspeople, and watching the sun paint the sky. It was peaceful. It was home. Yet, lately, a yearning ate at him.

The rhythmic roar of the waves seemed to mock his complacency. "Is this all there is?" it seemed to thunder. 

Then, a crumpled flyer danced past his face, carried by the wind. It advertised a local sailing competition – a grueling, multi-day race that tested physical prowess, navigational skills, and mental fortitude. A thrill shot through Callum. This was the challenge he craved.

He was exhilirated and up to the challenge. In no time at allp, he learned to read the wind, to navigate by the stars, to work as a team with his fellow sailors, a motley crew of locals and adventurous tourists.

The competition itself was a test of everything he'd learned. Gales threatened to capsize their vessel, and exhaustion gnawed at their bones. Yet, there was also a camaraderie forged in the crucible of shared struggle.

When they finally crossed the finish line, exhausted but exhilarated, Callum knew he was forever changed. The experience had instilled in him a newfound confidence, a willingness to embrace the challenges that lay ahead, whatever form they might take.

Back in the grove, the familiar routine felt comforting once more. The sight of his olive trees, heavy with fruit, was no longer monotonous; it was a source of solace. His home gave him strength and his adventures enriched it even more. 

## TLDR
Humans crave stability AND variety.

## Antifragile romantic relationships

While polyamory/ENM might seem like an outlier, its just another type of relationsip albeit more effortful. Let's look at the benefits and the inherent challenges.

**Vulnerability as Strength:**  This is the core of genuine, deep connections. When you leave yourself open to be said "no" to, reprimanded, scolded, made fun-of, or even humiliated you risk so much. Why? Becaused now your ego and self-worth can be attacked. However, is there any other way to realize your most personal desires with those you love? Also, by working through the "hard conversations" together, partners build **incredible trust** and **deep understanding**. 

**Beyond the Traditional Model:**  The very existence of functional polyamory throws a wrench into the assumption that monogamy is the only path to a happy and lasting partnership.  Couples are successfully navigating open arrangements, suggesting there's more than one way to find fulfillment within a committed relationship.


**The Range of Challenges:**  Polyamory/ENM also require a high degree of emotional maturity and self-awareness.  Partners need to navigate jealousy, insecurity, fear, and uncertainty. Not everyone possesses this level of maturity, and attempting a polyamory without it could be disastrous.  Uktimately, it requires constant communication and a willingness to adapt as needs and desires change.  

**Societal Hurdles:** Polyamory/ENM still face societal stigma, which can create strain on couples and their support networks. Navigating this stigma requires additional emotional resilience.  

## Benefits

Polyamory/ENM has the potential to enhance the quality of your connections. Here are a few reasons:

**Enhanced communication and confluct resolution** Having more than two partners requires a constant dance of transparency, not just with your primary partner but also with your additional flames. It's a pressure cooker that hones your ability to articulate needs, set boundaries, and navigate conflict with grace – skills that inevitably spill over and strengthen your other relationships.  

**Stronger support network** Polyamory/ENM can also unlock a treasure chest of support.  Imagine a constellation of connections, each offering a unique source of friendship, guidance, and emotional sustenance. 

**Greater sexual and emotional needs fulfilled** Finally, let's not forget the potential for a richer tapestry of experiences. Polyamory/ENM when approached with honesty and emotional maturity, can offer a broader spectrum of sexual and emotional fulfillment.  Imagine the possibility of exploring diverse desires and finding intimacy in ways that a single partner might not be able to fully satisfy. This exploration doesn't diminish the primary relationship; instead, it can lead to a more well-rounded and fulfilling emotional life.

**The Bottom Line:**  Polyamory/ENM is not a magic bullet. The success of these partnerships hinges on emotional maturity, a commitment to growth, and the ability to navigate societal stigma. It's not for everyone though.  

Lastly, whether polyamory & ENM becomes mainstream remains to be seen. History, however, points to yes.


## At the heart of the matter (pun intended)

Why does it matter and is there acsolution? 

Besides other cultural factors , destigmatize a legitimate relationship style at very least emphasize honest communication...

Polyamory is a relationship style with more than two romantic partners. It is under the umbrella of ethical non-monogamy (ENM) which is the broader term. ENM refers to swinging, dont-ask-dont-tell, open relationships etc. Here, I just refer polyamory...

In my view, there are two crucial questions to answer to determine if you're prepared for polyamory & ENM.  Can you be brutally honest with yourself about your desires and limitations? For many, it is no. 

Next comes the crucial exit –  honesty with your partner(s).  Can you have suncomfortable conversations with your partner(s)? Can you listen not just to their words, but the underlying anxieties they might mask? Again, for many people it's no.

Not everyone has the time, resources, or background (biological, cultural, etc) for polyamory / ENM.  There's no shame in that. What do I mean time and rsources? Time to cultuvate and maintain other partners. Resources for therapy, educational material, lifestyle-specific partner & community activities, mental health therapy, etc. There are potential more benefits but also costs associated with them.

## Angela and Gabe
The phone buzzed on the nightstand, illuminating Angela's face in the soft glow. It was Gabe, his message a cascade of words that made her heart skip a beat. "I think we could make it work," he said. They have been looking into polyamory - reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching videos. 

Five years of marriage, a comfortable routine, a well-worn path. But lately, a quiet discontent had settled in. Their careers had taken off in different directions, their friend groups evolved, and shared passions felt like forgotten songs.

Angela, ever the adventurer, was proposing an experiment – a chance to explore new experiences, ones that might not fit into their current mold. It was terrifying, like venturing off a well-worn map into uncharted territory. Yet, a rebellious ember flickered in Gabe too. Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't about breaking something, but about making it... antifragile.

Taking a fortifying breath, Angela messaged back, "Ok. Let's talk." Their usual spot, a cozy bookstore cafe, buzzed with the same nervous energy that crackled between them. Angela, anxious and excited, was a jumbled mess of explanations.  Gabe countered, a wry smile on his lips, "So, fragile egos are a dealbreaker then?"

Laughter, shaky and laced with tension, filled the air. The conversation flowed, halting at times, but raw with a newfound honesty. They talked about jealousy, boundaries, communication, even couples therapy. They had a lot scary things to say to eachother. It wasn't a done deal, but a step, a leap of faith into the messy, unpredictable world of antifragility.

As they walked out, the city lights twinkling against the twilight sky, Gabe felt a lightness he hadn't known existed. The road ahead was uncertain, but the fear was laced with a strange, exhilarating thrill.

## TLDR
Embracing the idea that you can grow from hardship even includes romantic relationships. An antifragile mindset is scary but can be very rewarding.



## Will accepting polyamory & ENM fix population collapse?

Very unlikely. If the endgame is more babies then it wont make a dent. Polyamory & ENM require more resource for them to wotk. The best scenario, in my opinion, is social acceptance. History seems to point "yes" to that outcome.

## What is polyamory & ENM and why?

todo: 50% divorce rare by age 50

Ethical non-monogamy (ENM), which encompasses open relationships and polyamory, is a relationship structure where partners agree to have romantic or intimate relationships with people outside of the primary couple. However, unlike cheating, ENM is based on  **open communication, consent, and clear boundaries**. 


![relationships](https://pebreo.github.io/IMG_0540.jpeg)
There are actually many more ...


Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

* **Open Communication:**  Honest and transparent discussions about desires, expectations, and boundaries are crucial. Partners openly discuss the possibility of having relationships with others and establish ground rules for those relationships.
* **Consent:**  Everyone involved, including existing partners and new partners, must give their full and enthusiastic consent to all aspects of the relationship. Coercion or manipulation is strictly off-limits.
* **Clear Boundaries:**  The level of openness in an ENM relationship can vary. Some couples might only be open to emotional connections, while others might be comfortable with physical intimacy as well.  It's important to define these boundaries clearly to avoid confusion or jealousy.

**Open Relationships:**

* This is a specific type of ENM where partners are open to having romantic or sexual relationships with others outside of the primary couple. 
* The focus might be on casual encounters or more committed secondary relationships.

**Polyamory:**

* This is another type of ENM where individuals can have multiple committed romantic relationships simultaneously, with the knowledge and consent of all partners involved. 
* Polyamorous relationships often involve a strong emotional connection and commitment between all partners, creating a network of love and support.

**Why might someone choose ENM?**

There are many reasons why people might choose ENM. Some might feel their emotional or physical needs aren't being fully met in a monogamous relationship.  Others might simply value having a wider range of connections and experiences. 

**It's important to remember that ENM isn't for everyone**. It requires a lot of emotional maturity, clear communication, and a willingness to navigate complex feelings. 

**Rethinking Relationships**

Developed countries face a paradox – declining birth rates coupled with riding divorce rates. This raises concerns about a shrinking workforce and a strain on social security systems. While promoting traditional family structures remains important, one approach could be explored: polyamory and ethical non-monogamy (ENM). 

It wouldn't be about dismantling traditional families, but offering an alternative structure that caters to individual needs and potentially prevents the bitter breakdowns that plague today's realities.


## We've seen this movie before
The concept of normalcy is a fascinatingly fluid one. Behaviors once deemed deviant, relegated to the fringes of society, have become commonplace as the world embraces the range of human experience. The following table shows once-deviant behavior as part of our cultural norms.

| Behavior                               | Current Status                                                                                            | Time Period Considered Deviant                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Women Wearing Pants                    | Common and fashionable clothing choice for women                                                          | 19th Century (seen as improper attire for women)                         |
| Rock and Roll                          | Mainstream genre of music                                                                                 | 1950s (seen as rebellious and potentially corrupting)                    |
| Dancing                                | Popular social activity and form of artistic expression                                                   | Varied throughout history (sometimes banned due to religious beliefs)    |
| Alcohol Use                            | Legal and socially accepted for adults in moderation (can still be problematic)                           | Varied throughout history (religious restrictions, temperance movements) |
| Tattoos                                | Widely accepted form of body art                                                                          | 18th-19th Centuries                                                      |
| Homosexuality                          | Legal and increasingly accepted in many parts of the world                                                | Throughout history, criminalized in many places                          |
| Interracial Relationships              | Legal and increasingly accepted in many parts of the world                                                | 18th-20th Centuries (illegal or socially unacceptable in many places)    |
| Marijuana Use (Medical & Recreational) | Legal for medical and/or recreational use in a growing number of countries (still illegal in many others) | 20th-21st Centuries (criminalized in many places)                        |
| Polyamory                              | More openly discussed and practiced, though not universally accepted                                      | Varies by culture (often seen as immoral or sinful)                      |


Let's breifly recap once-taboo cultural phenomenon, revisiting activities that were once met with raised eyebrows but wouldn't even bat an eye.

* **Body Art:** From the rebellious sailors sporting intricate tattoos to the self-expression of dyed hair, body modifications were once seen as a mark of deviance. Today, tattoos are a mainstream form of art, adorning bodies of all ages and professions, a testament to our evolving definition of beauty.

* **Love Without Borders:** Interracial relationships, once illegal in some places and frowned upon in many others, have become a beautiful reflection of our globalized world. Love stories defy borders, celebrating the richness that comes from embracing diversity.

* **The Power of Pants:**  Imagine a world where women couldn't wear pants! Shocking as it may seem, trousers were once deemed "masculine" attire. Thankfully, practicality and a shift in societal norms paved the way for pants to become a staple in any woman's wardrobe.

* **The Devil's Music:** Rock and roll, with its rebellious spirit and loud guitars, sent shockwaves through the 1950s. Now, it's a genre celebrated for its energy and innovation, a reminder that sometimes, the most disruptive forces can become the most beloved.




## TLDR 
People make mistakes so divorce is accepted. History shows cultural norms change. Polyamory & ENM just another relationship style. Its not for everyone.

## Why it would work
- humans crave stability AND variety
- honest communications builds & strengthends bonds
- existence proof in past & present

## What will happen
- enhanced communication & conflict resultion
- stronger support network
- greater emotional & sexual needs filled
- if still monogamous, stronger communication
