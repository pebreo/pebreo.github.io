## Angela and Mark
The phone buzzed on the nightstand, illuminating Angela's face in the soft glow. It was Mark, his message a cascade of words that made her heart skip a beat. "I think we could make it work," he said. They have been looking into polyamory - reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching videos. 

Five years of marriage, a comfortable routine, a well-worn path. But lately, a quiet discontent had settled in. Their careers had taken off in different directions, their friend groups evolved, and shared passions felt like forgotten songs.

Mark, ever the adventurer, was proposing an experiment – a chance to explore new experiences, ones that might not fit into their current mold. It was terrifying, like venturing off a well-worn map into uncharted territory. Yet, a rebellious ember flickered in Angela too. Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't about breaking something, but about making it... antifragile.

Taking a fortifying breath, Angela messaged back, "Ok. Let's talk." Their usual spot, a cozy bookstore cafe, buzzed with the same nervous energy that crackled between them. Mark, anxious and excited, was a jumbled mess of explanations.  Angela countered, a wry smile on her lips, "So, fragile egos are a dealbreaker then?"

Laughter, shaky and laced with tension, filled the air. The conversation flowed, halting at times, but raw with a newfound honesty. They talked about jealousy, boundaries, communication, even couples therapy. They had a lot scary things to say to eachother. It wasn't a done deal, but a step, a leap of faith into the messy, unpredictable world of antifragility.

As they walked out, the city lights twinkling against the twilight sky, Angela felt a lightness she hadn't known existed. The road ahead was uncertain, but the fear was laced with a strange, exhilarating thrill.

## TLDR
Adopting the idea that you can grow from hardship even includes romantic relationships. An antifragile mindset is scary but can be very rewarding.



**Rethinking Relationships**

Developed countries face a paradox – declining birth rates coupled with high divorce rates. This raises concerns about a shrinking workforce and a strain on social security systems. While promoting traditional family structures remains important, one approach could be explored: polyamory and ethical non-monogamy (ENM). 

When practiced ethically (ie no lying or hiding) and with clear communication, could prevent divorces.  The all-too common scenario  where a couple desires children but struggles with emotional or physical intimacy. In polyamory/ENM, they could explore those needs with compatible partners outside the relationship,  potentially strengthening their core bond  by alleviating pressure and fostering open communication. It wouldn't be about dismantling traditional families, but offering an alternative structure that caters to individual needs and potentially prevents the bitter breakdowns that plague modern marriages.

Although polyamory & ENM challenges societal norms, it offer couples a choice and a way to address individual needs for intimacy and fulfillment while maintaining a stable family unit. These open relationships, when navigated with honesty and clear communication, could reduce the costly and very painful wounds of divorce. How many families has this affected? How much temporary and permant damage does it cause? Is it worth looking into? The success of this relationship style being just another option hinges on cultural acceptance and responsible implementation. 

## We've seen this movie before
The concept of normalcy is a fascinatingly fluid one. Behaviors once deemed deviant, relegated to the fringes of society, have become commonplace as the world embraces the range of human experience.

Let's breifly recap once-taboo cultural phenomenon, revisiting activities that were once met with raised eyebrows but wouldn't even bat an eye.

* **Body Art:** From the rebellious sailors sporting intricate tattoos to the self-expression of dyed hair, body modifications were once seen as a mark of deviance. Today, tattoos are a mainstream form of art, adorning bodies of all ages and professions, a testament to our evolving definition of beauty.

* **Love Without Borders:** Interracial relationships, once illegal in some places and frowned upon in many others, have become a beautiful reflection of our globalized world. Love stories defy borders, celebrating the richness that comes from embracing diversity.

* **The Power of Pants:**  Imagine a world where women couldn't wear pants! Shocking as it may seem, trousers were once deemed "masculine" attire. Thankfully, practicality and a shift in societal norms paved the way for pants to become a staple in any woman's wardrobe.

* **The Devil's Music:** Rock and roll, with its rebellious spirit and loud guitars, sent shockwaves through the 1950s. Now, it's a genre celebrated for its energy and innovation, a reminder that sometimes, the most disruptive forces can become the most beloved.

* **The Joy of Movement:** From the swirling waltzes of the past to the pulsating beats of today's clubs, dancing has faced its fair share of criticism. Yet, the primal urge to move our bodies transcends cultural boundaries, reminding us of the universal language of joy and expression.

* **A Toast (in Moderation):** Alcohol consumption has had a complex history, with periods of strict prohibition and social acceptance. Today, responsible drinking is a part of many cultures, a reminder that even "deviant" behaviors can be enjoyed in moderation.

* **The Green Debate:** Marijuana, demonized for decades, is now finding acceptance for both medical and recreational uses. This shift reflects a growing openness to explore alternative treatments and redefine our relationship with psychoactive substances.

* **Beyond Monogamy:** Open relationships, once considered taboo, are being discussed more openly as people explore different ways to structure love and intimacy. Whether this becomes mainstream remains to be seen, but it highlights the ongoing evolution of our understanding of human connection.

These are just a few examples of how societal norms have shifted, embracing once-deviant behaviors. This is a pattern we've seen before. In my experience, venturing outside your comfort zones, enriches your life. The journey continues, and finding a different relationship path can lead to pain and heartache but also wonderful possibilities.
