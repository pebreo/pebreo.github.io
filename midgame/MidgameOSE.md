## Marcin
Marcin squinted at the endless rows of wheat, his calloused hand tracing a hesitant line down a stalk. The city life, once a vibrant dream, now felt like a faded photograph compared to the earthy canvas stretching before him. He was a farmer now, a decision fueled by a yearning for simpler things, not a fat bank account.

His pride and joy, a rusty but rumbling tractor named Bertha, chugged along the furrows, leaving behind a trail of freshly turned soil. The joy of seeing life sprout where there was only dust was a balm to his soul. Until, with a sputter and a cough, Bertha lurched to a stop. Panic clawed at Marcin's throat. He had barely scraped together enough to buy the darn thing, let alone repairs.

Days turned into weeks as Marcin nursed Bertha back to health, every penny heâ€™d saved going towards the mechanic. He worked tirelessly by hand, his back aching, sweat stinging his eyes, but the thought of his wife, Elara, and their two young children with empty plates spurred him on.

Just as hope flickered back, a sickening crunch shattered the morning quiet. Bertha, spewing smoke, refused to budge. Despair threatened to engulf Marcin. He stared at the endless fields, the dream turning into a nightmare. How would he feed his family? How could he explain this to Elara, her eyes already etched with worry?

That evening, Elara placed a steaming bowl of stew in front of him. Her smile, though strained, held a strength that mirrored the wheat swaying in the breeze. "We'll figure it out," she said, her voice firm. 

## TLDR
The status quo is planned obsolence. Bad things can happen and really hurt you. Not everyone can afford the newest, best, or even unexpected
