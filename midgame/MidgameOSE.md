## Marcin
Marcin squinted at the endless rows of wheat, his calloused hand tracing a hesitant line down a stalk. The city life, once a vibrant dream, now felt like a faded photograph compared to the earthy canvas stretching before him. He was a farmer now, a decision fueled by a yearning for simpler things, not a fat bank account.

His pride and joy, a rusty but rumbling tractor named Bertha, chugged along the furrows, leaving behind a trail of freshly turned soil. The joy of seeing life sprout where there was only dust was a balm to his soul. Until, with a sputter and a cough, Bertha lurched to a stop. Panic clawed at Marcin's throat. He had barely scraped together enough to buy the darn thing, let alone repairs.

Days turned into weeks as Marcin nursed Bertha back to health, every penny he’d saved going towards the mechanic. He worked tirelessly by hand, his back aching, sweat stinging his eyes, but the thought of his wife, Elara, and their two young children with empty plates spurred him on.

Just as hope flickered back, a sickening crunch shattered the morning quiet. Bertha, spewing smoke, refused to budge. Despair threatened to engulf Marcin. He stared at the endless fields, the dream turning into a nightmare. How would he feed his family? How could he explain this to Elara, her eyes already etched with worry?

That evening, Elara placed a steaming bowl of stew in front of him. Her smile, though strained, held a strength that mirrored the wheat swaying in the breeze. "We'll figure it out," she said, her voice firm. To be continued...

## TLDR
The status quo is planned obsolence. Bad things can happen and really hurt you. Not everyone can afford the newest, best, or even unexpected repairs.


## Lotus
Lotus, a waitress at the local diner, scrolled through social media. "Freedom dividend? What's that?" she muttered, tapping on an article.  The world of economics could be confusing, but this one piqued her interest. 

The article explained freedom dividend like this: Imagine the government giving everyone, young or old, working or not, a monthly check.  Enough to cover basic needs – rent, groceries, maybe some bills.  Lotus' eyes widened.  "Free money? Sounds too good to be true."

Intrigued, she kept reading.  Proponents, the article said, argued the freedom dividemd would be a safety net. Like training wheels for a bike, it would catch you if you fell on hard times – lost your job, got sick, or faced an unexpected expense.  No more ramen noodles for weeks! Plus, with that little financial cushion, people might be more likely to pursue new skills or even start their own businesses. Innovation boom! 

But hold on, Lotus thought.  Wouldn't this cost a fortune? The article conceded that yes, the freedom dividend would be expensive. The government would need to figure out how to pay for it, maybe by adjusting some taxes.  Also, certainly a few people might become complacent, relying on the check instead of seeking work. 

## TLDR
The freedom dividend can be used as safety net or a crutch. It depends on the person.
