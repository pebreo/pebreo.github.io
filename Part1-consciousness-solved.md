## Intelligence solved : memory + prediction


Rain lashed against the window, the rhythmic drumming a familiar lullaby to the old dog, Milo. Curled beside the fireplace, he watched the embers dance, their flickering glow painting memories on the backs of his eyelids. He remembered chasing butterflies as a pup, the exhilaration of the hunt, the sweet scent of summer meadows clinging to his fur.  

A twig snapped outside, pulling Milo from his reverie. Ears perked, he lifted his head, instantly recalling the countless times that sound meant a raccoon prowling for scraps. His body tensed, not in blind fear, but in calculated caution. Years of experience had woven a tapestry of memories, each thread a past encounter, each knot a learned response.

He didn't need to see the raccoon to predict its next move. It would circle the house, drawn by the scent of dinner, then attempt an entry point - the back door, most likely. With a sigh, Milo thumped his tail against the floor, a pre-emptive warning.  

His human, Sarah, stirred on the couch. "Something wrong, boy?" she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep. 

Milo whined softly, his gaze fixed on the back door. Sarah followed his line of sight, understanding dawning in her eyes.  She rose slowly, the familiar creak of the floorboards another thread in the vast tapestry of their shared memories. 

Together, they moved as a unit, a silent symphony honed by experience. Sarah grabbed a flashlight, the beam a comforting presence in the dark. Milo crept towards the back door, using his knowledge of the house's layout to position himself for a strategic intercept. 

The raccoon, as predicted, was there, its beady eyes reflecting the flashlight's beam. A growl rumbled from Milo's throat, a sound born not just of instinct, but of the countless past confrontations that had taught him the language of dominance. The raccoon, recognizing the futility of its attempt, slunk away, melting back into the storm. 

Milo relaxed, a satisfied rumble escaping his chest. He hadn't needed complex commands or spoken language. The dance between him and Sarah, the memories woven into their very being, had been enough. In that quiet victory, under the glow of the dying fire, a testament to countless shared experiences, flickered the essence of consciousness â€“ a world built not just on actions, but on the powerful interplay of memory and prediction.

## Rethinking Consciousness: It's More Than Just Actions

For many years, scientists have attempted to pinpoint the exact definition of consciousness. Is it simply a matter of complex behavior? Or is there something more to it? In a recent development, the co-creator of the Palm Pilot, Jeff Hawkins, has proposed a new theory that goes beyond behavior and focuses on two key components: memory and prediction.

Hawkins argues that consciousness shouldn't be solely defined by how an organism acts. Instead, it's the ability to form memories of past experiences and use those memories to predict future outcomes that truly sets conscious beings apart. This concept goes beyond just reacting to stimuli; it involves a level of understanding and anticipation.

This theory also acknowledges the existence of qualia, the subjective experience of things like sight, sound, and taste. While qualia is difficult to quantify or objectively measure, it's an undeniable aspect of consciousness.

Hawkins' proposal offers a fresh perspective on the ongoing debate about consciousness. By focusing on memory, prediction, and qualia, it provides a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be truly conscious.

This new theory has the potential to impact various fields, from artificial intelligence research to our understanding of animal cognition. If consciousness truly is rooted in memory and prediction, then our efforts to create conscious machines may need to be refocused. 

The idea also opens doors for further exploration into animal consciousness. By observing an animal's ability to form memories and use them to predict future events, we may gain a deeper understanding of their cognitive abilities.

Whether Hawkins' theory ultimately holds true, it certainly sparks important conversations about the nature of consciousness. As we continue to explore this complex phenomenon, his ideas offer a valuable framework for further investigation.
