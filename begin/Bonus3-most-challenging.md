Why climb a mountain?

paragraph 2 
We understood that having high difficulty is just one way to provide an intense feeling of accomplishment through preparing strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things. - Hitedataka Miyezaki, From Software


In a typical video game, there three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. In a Souls game theres only one difficulty: f*** you.

**In the realm of video games, there exists a spectrum of challenges. Most games offer a trio of difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. These labels suggest a gradual escalation of adversity, a gentle curve leading to a more demanding experience. But then there are the Souls games. In these digital realms, there is no such gradation. There is only one difficulty: a relentless, unforgiving gauntlet.**

**This singular level of challenge is not merely a gimmick. It is a deliberate design choice that yields profound rewards.** The arduous tasks, the seemingly insurmountable obstacles, force players to adapt, to learn from their mistakes, and to develop a deep understanding of the game's mechanics. The satisfaction that comes from overcoming such challenges is unparalleled. It is a triumph of skill, perseverance, and a touch of luck.

**By focusing on a single difficulty level, game designers are freed from the constraints of balancing multiple modes.** They can devote their energies to crafting intricate enemies, stunning environments, and unique weapons. The result is a more immersive and rewarding experience for those who are willing to embrace the challenge.

**However, it is important to acknowledge that this extreme level of difficulty is not for everyone.** The Souls games appeal to a specific audience, those who relish the thrill of overcoming seemingly impossible odds. For others, the relentless punishment can be frustrating and discouraging. It is a double-edged sword, offering immense satisfaction to some while alienating others.

So, given the above, how does a video game have anythibg to do with polyamory & ethical non-monogamy? Three things: overcoming the challenges can be rewarding, it requires much effort (be it time, money, psychological work), its not for everybody.

**The tapestry of human connection is a complex and intricate one.** While most of us navigate the waters of love and intimacy with a single partner, there are those who choose to explore the uncharted territories of polyamory and ethical non-monogamy. These paths, while unconventional, offer a unique set of challenges and rewards.

**Maintaining a successful relationship with a single romantic partner requires a significant investment of time, effort, and resources.** It is a delicate balancing act that demands constant attention, compromise, and a willingness to adapt. Now, imagine the complexity of navigating such a relationship with multiple partners. Image the amoubt of self-awareness, emotial control, and communication needed to nsvigate simultaneous multiple romantic partners. The emotional and psychological demands are significantly increased to day the least.

**Polyamory and ethical non-monogamy necessitate a profound understanding of one's own emotions, boundaries, and desires.** It requires a level of self-awareness that is often challenging to achieve. Additionally, navigating the intricacies of multiple relationships can be emotionally taxing, making therapy an invaluable tool for many. This, in turn, requires a significant investment of time and financial resources.

**Time management is a crucial skill for those who choose to embrace polyamory or ethical non-monogamy.** Juggling multiple relationships requires careful planning, effective communication, and a willingness to prioritize. It is a delicate dance that demands a deep understanding of one's own limitations and the ability to set boundaries.

**While the path of polyamory or ethical non-monogamy may be unconventional, it offers a unique opportunity for personal growth, emotional fulfillment, and the exploration of new depths of human connection.** However, it is a journey that requires a significant investment of time, effort, and resources, and a willingness to embrace the challenges that lie ahead.
