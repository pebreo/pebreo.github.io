We understood that having high difficulty is just one way to provide an intense feeling of accomplishment through preparing strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things. - Hitedataka Miyezaki, From Software


In a typical video game, there three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. In a Souls game theres only one difficulty: f*** you.

**In the realm of video games, there exists a spectrum of challenges. Most games offer a trio of difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. These labels suggest a gradual escalation of adversity, a gentle curve leading to a more demanding experience. But then there are the Souls games. In these digital realms, there is no such gradation. There is only one difficulty: a relentless, unforgiving gauntlet.**

**This singular level of challenge is not merely a gimmick. It is a deliberate design choice that yields profound rewards.** The arduous tasks, the seemingly insurmountable obstacles, force players to adapt, to learn from their mistakes, and to develop a deep understanding of the game's mechanics. The satisfaction that comes from overcoming such challenges is unparalleled. It is a triumph of skill, perseverance, and a touch of luck.

**By focusing on a single difficulty level, game designers are freed from the constraints of balancing multiple modes.** They can devote their energies to crafting intricate enemies, stunning environments, and unique weapons. The result is a more immersive and rewarding experience for those who are willing to embrace the challenge.

**However, it is important to acknowledge that this extreme level of difficulty is not for everyone.** The Souls games appeal to a specific audience, those who relish the thrill of overcoming seemingly impossible odds. For others, the relentless punishment can be frustrating and discouraging. It is a double-edged sword, offering immense satisfaction to some while alienating others.
