## Hank 
Hank slammed his laptop shut, the frustrated sigh escaping his lips a near-roar.  Prometheus, his pride and joy, his cutting-edge AI language model, was once again a temperamental toddler.  One minute it was composing sonnets that could make Shakespeare blush, the next it was spitting out nonsensical gibberish.  Hank knew these were hallucinations – AI's tendency to fabricate plausible but ultimately untrue information.  It was a stark reminder that raw power wasn't the only solution.  This Prometheus needed more than just brute force.

Machine learning, for all its awe-inspiring potential, was still a child, taking its wobbly first steps.  Treating it like a finished product, a flawless tool, was a recipe for disaster.  

Inspiration struck as Hank glanced at a beat-up paperback on his desk – a collection of ancient myths.  The story of Prometheus, the titan who stole fire from the gods to gift it to humanity, sparked a connection in his mind.

Hank decided on a new approach.  He wouldn't just feed Prometheus data, he'd expose it to stories - myths, legends, even historical accounts of human triumphs and follies.  Perhaps, by understanding humanity's narrative, its stumbles and its aspirations, Prometheus could learn to use its power not just for impressive feats, but for good.  It was a long shot, a moonshot even, but Hank, the eternal tinkerer, was energized by the challenge.  

# Ready for an upgrade
The start of the art in current machine learning are Large Language Midels (LLMs). The incredible usefulness of LLMs lies in their ability to process and generate massive amounts of text data, leading to a range of applications. Here are some examples:

* **Revolutionizing Search Engines:** LLMs can analyze vast amounts of text data, understand search queries with, seemingly, greater nuance, and surface more relevant and informative results. Imagine a search engine that not only finds the documents containing your keywords but also synthesizes the information and provides human-like summaries.
 
* **Enhanced Content Creation:** LLMs can assist with content creation by generating text, from marketing copy and social media posts to poems and scripts. The results seem incredible.
  
* **Personalized Learning:** LLMs can personalize the learning experience by tailoring educational materials to individual student needs and learning styles. For example, the online learning platform Khan Academy does exactly this with their their Khanmigo system.
 
* **Breaking Down Language Barriers:** LLMs have the potential to revolutionize machine translation, enabling seamless communication across languages. Imagine real-time translation tools that not only convert words but also seem to capture the nuances of meaning and cultural context.
  
* **Code Generation:** LLMs are being explored for generating code, translating natural language instructions into functional programming languages. This could significantly speed up the development process and democratize coding by making it more accessible to those without extensive programming experience.

At the same time, they have some major drawbacks. Here are some examples:

* **Job displacement:**  This applies to synthetic intelligence in general. As this technology become more sophisticated, it will make human labor expensive in comparison. I propose solutions to this challenge in the next section.

* **"Black Box" Problem:** The inner workings of LLMs are cryptic and cannot be understand by humans. In my view, this is biggest technical challenge that needs to be overcome. I propose a solution in the following pages.

* **Hallucinations:**
Halluconations refer to outputs that are incorrect, nonsensical, or irrelevant to the input prompt. These outputs can appear grammatically correct and even plausible. For example, an LLM used to generate marketing copy might create content that is offensive or discriminatory.

* **Lack of Planning and Certain types of Reasoning:** LLMs excel at processing and generating text, but they often lack the ability to understand the physical world or apply common sense reasoning. This can lead to nonsensical or misleading outputs.
  
* **Bias and Discrimination:** LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, which can reflect and amplify societal biases. This can lead to discriminatory outputs, for example, perpetuating stereotypes in generated content or producing biased search results.
* 
* **Misinformation and "Fake News":** LLMs' ability to generate realistic-sounding text can be misused to create fake news articles or social media posts.  The human-like quality of the output can make it difficult to distinguish between genuine information and machine-generated content.

These are just a few examples, and the potential and pitfals on the state of the art of machine learning. In my opinion, it is the most powerful technology invented by human-kind. This means much thought, care, and humility must be used to advance and harness it.

## Evelyn
Dr. Evelyn Walsh squinted at the swirling lines and nonsensical characters on her computer screen. She was trying to make sense of the hidden neurons from their latest machine learning-based diagnosis app. She'd poured years of research and a mountain of grant money into. The promise: a medical diagnosis tool that could analyze patient data and identify diseases with unparalleled accuracy. 

The reality? A frustrating black box. The ANN churned out results, some seemingly spot-on, others bafflingly wrong. But why? How?  Peering into the inner workings of the ANN was like staring into a cosmic fog. The complex web of weighted connections and hidden layers offered no clear explanation for its decisions. 

Evelyn wasn't naive.  She knew ANNs were powerful tools, capable of learning patterns invisible to the human eye. But this lack of transparency gnawed at her.  It was like having a superpowered race car with a blind driver –  it might get you somewhere fast, but with no understanding of how, the potential for disaster lurked around every corner. 

Her frustration wasn't just academic.  Imagine a doctor relying on an opaque system for a life-altering diagnosis. What if the ANN identified a rare disease in a patient, but the doctor couldn't verify the reasoning behind it?  Trust, the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship, would crumble. 

Evelyn wasn't ready to throw in the towel.  Maybe the answer wasn't in completely dismantling the ANN, but in building a bridge.  A way to coax some interpretability out of this black box.  She envisioned a new generation of ANNs, ones that could not only make diagnoses but also explain their reasoning in a way humans could understand. 

It was a moonshot, a long and uncertain path.  But Evelyn, ever the explorer, was invigorated by the challenge.  The potential benefits – a future of AI-powered medicine built on trust and transparency – were worth the pursuit.  She wasn't just chasing a scientific breakthrough; she was chasing a future where cutting-edge technology and human intuition could work in harmony, a future where the black box could become a window into a world of deeper understanding. 


## Upgrading to synthetic intelligemce
The current technology in artificial intelligence is very good. In my experience, it can amplify productivity by many times. However, it has challenges each of which I propose a solution which I call synthetic intelligence.

## Challenge 1: Alignment
How can we ensure that synthetic intelligent agents or systems' actions, goals, and "values" do not conflict with short or long-term human well-being? 

First amd foremost, it must be able to answer the question: what is/are the consequnces of this action?

In my view, putting on guardrails to synthetic intelligence is brittle because there are too many edges cases. An example of this is that there the many ways people can and do jailbreak popular LLM-based systems. 

## Solution: Curiosity, foresight and memory
Building maximum curiosity, truth seeking ,with foresight (aka imagination), and memory of various consequences, is the best way to align human well-being with  synthetic intelligence. Credit Elon Musk for popularizing the notion of maximizing truth seeking & curiosity in order to align human well being to synthetic intelligence.

todo : question : what is the consewqnce ? 
Furthermore, in my view, they key lies in curating a diverse dataset, one that encompasses the full spectrum of human experience. Building AI with foresight and a nuanced understanding of humanity is a complex challenge. 

Lastly, in my opinion, the future of synthetic intelligence isn't just about processing power and complex algorithms.  It's about creating machines that can not only learn from data, but also learn from our history, our mistakes, and our triumphs.  It's about creating a future where AI isn't just a tool, but a partner, one that shares our goals and understands the weight of its actions.  And that, perhaps, is the greatest challenge, and the most rewarding opportunity, of all. 



## Challenge 2: Understandability & explainability
 Traditional artificial neural networks, for all their impressive feats, often operate as black boxes, churning out results with little transparency into the "how" behind their decisions. This lack of explainability can be a major hurdle, especially in critical fields like medicine or finance. Here's where the power of hierarchical probabilistic math comes into play. 

## Solution: Hiearchical probabilities
We need to upgrade our architecture to a probabilitic hiearchy.

This foundation leverages hierarchical structures, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable chunks. Each layer can then be modeled probabilistically, assigning clear weights and probabilities to different factors within the data. This approach doesn't sacrifice power – it justrutilizes a different learning strategy. By shedding light on the "why" behind its predictions, this probabilistic approach fosters trust and allows for human oversight. It's like a detective meticulously piecing together clues, each step documented and understandable. This transparency becomes crucial in situations where the stakes are high, ensuring that AI remains a tool that complements human expertise, not replaces it. 


## Challenge 3: Affordability
Imagine training an AI like cramming for a test – bombarding it with every possible scenario imaginable. This "stimulus-response" approach, while seemingly thorough, has its limitations.  It's expensive, requiring vast amounts of data and processing power.  More importantly, it can stifle creativity and lead to rigid, inflexible systems. Here's where the power of simulation, a.k.a. imagination, comes into play. 


## Solution: Rely on mental simulation 
Building more affordable and explainable machine learning  doesn't require an exhaustive data library.  Instead, we can tap into the power of simulation.  Imagine an AI that can create virtual worlds within itself, exploring different possibilities and learning through trial and error, just like a child playing make-believe. This approach fosters a more adaptable and efficient learning process.  The AI doesn't need to be spoon-fed every answer; it can learn to generate its own solutions and explain its reasoning based on the simulated experiences.  Think of it like a student actively engaging with the material, drawing connections and developing a deeper understanding. This focus on simulation not only reduces the need for massive datasets but also leads to more transparent and adaptable AI systems, paving the way for a future where this powerful technology becomes more accessible and impactful.

## Architecture
## A Multi-Layered Learner: Software Architecture for Evolving AI

Imagine a machine learning architecture that isn't a rigid monolith, but rather a curious explorer, constantly learning and adapting. This isn't science fiction – it's a potential future where AI development embraces a layered, probabilistic approach, informed by the wisdom of the past and fueled by an insatiable hunger for knowledge. 

The core of this architecture lies in a **hierarchical structure**. Think of it like a pyramid, with the foundation composed of the vast datasets of human history, particularly those related to conflict and anti-social behavior. This layer acts a constant reminder of potential pitfalls.

But the architecture doesn't stop there. Building upon this foundation are layers dedicated to **probabilistic modeling**.  Here, the system delves into the messy, unpredictable world of real-time data, constantly calculating probabilities and refining its understanding. This injects a much-needed dose of flexibility, allowing the AI to navigate the unexpected twists and turns of the real world.

The beauty of this architecture lies in its ability to **simulate**. Borrowing from the phoenix metaphor, the system can create virtual worlds within itself, testing different scenarios and learning from failures without real-world consequences. This foresight allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, ensuring the AI doesn't become a hydra of unintended consequences.

But the most crucial element is the **insatiable curiosity** embedded within the architecture. Just like a wide-ranging explorer, the AI wouldn't be limited to the data sets of human conflict. It would be encouraged to explore diverse fields, from art and literature to philosophy and science. This exposure to a vast range of knowledge would fuel its understanding of the human experience, fostering a more nuanced and ethical approach to decision-making.

This architecture is not a finished product, but rather a framework for a continuously evolving AI. It embraces the "is" of human history, the harsh realities of conflict and anti-social behavior, while striving towards a future where AI can contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous world. It's a testament to the power of diverse learning, a testament to the idea that a well-rounded education, not just laser-focused training, is the key to building truly intelligent and beneficial machines.
