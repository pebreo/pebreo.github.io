# Rise and shine

Golden giants, reaching for the sky, 
Their faces bright, a summer's sigh. 
But beneath their cheerful, sunny gleam, 
A darker tale, a troubled dream.
Financial woes, a heavy weight, 
Pressing down, a cruel fate. 
Yet, in the midst of this despair, 
Love's warmth, a beacon, shining there.
Loved ones' hands, a comforting hold, 
Their words of hope, a story told. 
Together, they'll weather any storm, 
Their bond unyielding, strong and warm.
So let the sunflowers stand as proof, 
Of hope's resilience, love's aloof. 
Though trials may come, and darkness creep, 
Their spirits soar, their dreams they keep.

The thesis of the book is using the convergence of technology to upgrade all of humanity. But first, there are some pressing issues we have to deal with first in this country. One of those is the fact that the transition to using robots and automation will temporarily and/or permanently those in our communities behind. As a temporarily solution, I propose The Freedom Dividend. (See here for the ultimate solution)

However, there are 3 main criticisms:

causes inflation

disincentive to work

doesnâ€™t really make people any happier

My reply to those concerns are:

robots and automation will essentially be free labor, so it is massively deflationary. they cancel out.

people want to work. the dividend is just a stopgap. GOAT socioeconomics is the solution.

to make people happier, upgrade to GOAT socioeconomics

I explain more in my video.
