# What our best friends can teach of intelligence

## Milo
Rain lashed against the window, the rhythmic drumming a familiar lullaby to the old dog, Milo. Curled beside the fireplace, he watched the embers dance, their flickering glow painting memories on the backs of his eyelids. He remembered chasing butterflies as a pup, the exhilaration of the hunt, the sweet scent of summer meadows clinging to his fur.  

A twig snapped outside, pulling Milo from his reverie. Ears perked, he lifted his head, instantly recalling the countless times that sound meant a raccoon prowling for scraps. His body tensed, not in blind fear, but in calculated caution. Years of experience had woven a tapestry of memories, each thread a past encounter, each knot a learned response.

He didn't need to see the raccoon to predict its next move. It would circle the house, drawn by the scent of dinner, then attempt an entry point - the back door, most likely. With a sigh, Milo thumped his tail against the floor, a pre-emptive warning.  

His human, Sarah, stirred on the couch. "Something wrong, boy?" she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep. 

Milo whined softly, his gaze fixed on the back door. Sarah followed his line of sight, understanding dawning in her eyes.  She rose slowly, the familiar creak of the floorboards another thread in the vast tapestry of their shared memories. 

Together, they moved as a unit, a silent symphony honed by experience. Sarah grabbed a flashlight, the beam a comforting presence in the dark. Milo crept towards the back door, using his knowledge of the house's layout to position himself for a strategic intercept. 

The raccoon, as predicted, was there, its beady eyes reflecting the flashlight's beam. A growl rumbled from Milo's throat, a sound born not just of instinct, but of the countless past confrontations that had taught him the language of dominance. The raccoon, recognizing the futility of its attempt, slunk away, melting back into the storm. 

Milo relaxed, a satisfied rumble escaping his chest. He hadn't needed complex commands or spoken language. The dance between him and Sarah, the memories woven into their very being, had been enough. In that quiet victory, under the glow of the dying fire, a testament to countless shared experiences, flickered the essence of intelligence – a world built not just on actions, but on the powerful interplay of memory and prediction. 

### Intelligence solved

What is intelligence? Is it simply a matter of complex behavior? Or is there something more to it? I believe the most convincing definition of intelligence was given by the co-creator of the Palm Pilot, Jeff Hawkins, who posits you need two things to be intelligent: memory and prediction.

Hawkins argues that intelligence shouldn't be solely defined by how an organism acts. Instead, it's the ability to form memories of past experiences and use those memories to predict future outcomes. This concept goes beyond just reacting to stimuli.

In my view, then our efforts to create intelligent machines need to be refocused. 


## Redefining Intelligence: Beyond Complex Behavior

The question of what truly constitutes intelligence has captivated philosophers and scientists for millennia. Is it simply the ability to perform complex behaviors  - a bird building a nest, a dog fetching a ball? Or is there something deeper, a wellspring of understanding and foresight? 

Jeff Hawkins, co-creator of the Palm Pilot, offers a compelling perspective. He argues that intelligence hinges on two key pillars: **memory** and **prediction**.  According to Hawkins, true intelligence isn't just about reacting to stimuli in the moment. It's the ability to draw upon a vast repository of past experiences (memories) and leverage them to anticipate what might happen next (prediction). This allows intelligent beings to not only react but also to plan, to learn from mistakes, and to adapt to new situations.

This reframing of intelligence has profound implications for our pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI development has focused on mimicking complex human behaviors  - playing chess, translating languages, recognizing objects. However, Hawkins' definition suggests a more fundamental shift is required.  We need to move beyond simply replicating actions and instead focus on building machines that can learn and remember, that can utilize the past to inform the future.

Here's why this memory-prediction approach is so crucial:

* **Understanding the World:**  Memories provide context and meaning to our experiences.  They allow us to understand the world around us, not just as a series of isolated events, but as a connected web of cause and effect.  By building AI with robust memory capabilities, we enable it to learn from past interactions and develop a richer understanding of its environment.  

* **Breaking Free from Repetition:**  Purely reactive AI systems, devoid of memory and prediction, are trapped in a cycle of responding to immediate stimuli.  They can excel at rote tasks, but struggle with anything that requires adaptation or novel problem-solving.  Memory and prediction, however, allow AI to break free from this cycle.  By drawing on past experiences and anticipating future outcomes, AI can develop more flexible and creative solutions.  

* **Lifelong Learning:**  The human capacity for lifelong learning is a cornerstone of our intelligence.  We learn from every experience, big or small, and constantly refine our understanding of the world.  Memory and prediction are the engines that drive this learning process.  By equipping AI with these capabilities, we enable it to continuously learn and improve, becoming more sophisticated and adaptable over time.

**Refocusing our efforts on memory and prediction in AI development is not to diminish the importance of complex behavior.**  After all, the ability to act on our predictions is a crucial aspect of intelligence.  However, it's by prioritizing memory and prediction that we unlock the true potential of AI –  the ability to not just mimic human behavior, but to achieve a deeper understanding of the world and navigate it with purpose. 


## TLDR
Problem: there isn't a clear, agreed upon, definition of intelligence.

Solution: intelligence is not behavior, it's memory plus prediction.
