quotes:
1 Corinthians 13 v2
And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

If i have further is is because i have stood on the shoukders of giants. - Newton

## the plan
This book describes an ambitious plan to upgrade humanity. Here it is in a nutshell.

First and foremosst, we must adopt an antifragile mindset. Let's embrace the messiness of life with an **antifragile mindset**. We're not just built to endure, we can actually thrive on the inevitable lows of life.  Think of hydra: cut off a head, two more grow.

Next, time to upgrade love. Maybe traditional models don't quite fit everyone. Let's **destigmatize** exploring different relationship structures, like polyamory or ethical non-monogamy (ENM) ones. Afterall, but core of relationship doesn't change: honesty, communication, and vulnerability. And its time to upgrade our relationships.

Now, the next game-changer: **karma socioeconomics**. Imagine a system built on human-aligned AI and blockchain. The AI is transparent, explainable, and works for everyone, not just a privileged few. Blockchain keeps things secure, and everyone's on the same page. Sounds ambitious, but with the convergence of technology its within humanity's grasp.

The result? A world where hunger, poverty, and disease become relics of the past.  War? It becomes a painful, distant memory.

**Infinite growth** becomes not just possible, but encouraged. Human connection thrives, and innovation explodes as every human becomes an Innovator. This would be a whole new era for humanity, one built on the power of diverse experiences and a willingness to explore the unknown. Now that's a future worth getting excited about.

- airplanes - metallurgy, chemistry
- internet - math, electronics, mass manufacturing
- automobile - metallurgy, rubber, mass mfg
- antibiotics - microscope, germ theory, ?&

## Why this would work
- The technologies are built and setup to facilitate the plan
- Weve seen convergence of technologies **many** times before
- Most people think it's worth it and on-board

## Implications
- Breath-taking possibilities
