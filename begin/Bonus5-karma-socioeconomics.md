medium of exchange - in my book, i describe what make a person wealthy socially, emotionallky, and fonancially


unit of account - wiiyh tireless, near infinitkey meticulous SI it will be possible to quantify behavior

store of value - since si will make gooods & service essentially free (initial & margin), the other thibg to value are once-intangible things: trust, loyalty, risk-taking, fortitude, creativity, compassion, generosity, nearly all things thst create & strengthen whst humsns vslue do much: human connection.

I normally dont use these many superlatives in my daily life, but writing this book and thinking about this , i coukdnt help but be overwhelmed by the staggering implications. i hope you join me in spreading the word. buy my book ;)

explain the status quo and the picture as inflection point

status quo
post inflection 


The inflection point of SI & quantum physics-hardened blockchain, unlock the possibilty to upgrade our currency: marry social currency with material currency. To do that, it will have to change the 3 fundamental aspects of currency: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Lets briefly look at each using visuals to make it easier to accept/imagine/understand.

Under thevststus quo, the soluton is two. By inventing a solution, weve created a win-win situation. ðŸ˜Ž

how is social wealth accumulated? interactions, experiences, inventions, art

how is materisl wealth accumulated? same as above!

Inflection points unlock possibilities

The discovery of fire was a flicker in the darkness which gave warmth from the cold night and helped satiate our desperate hunger for meat we now cook without fear of parasites or diseases. It was a spark, a beginning. From that initial invention, a cascade of innovations followed, unlocking ability to enjoy food recipes, travel at night, even communicate smoke signals. Each new discovery, a stepping stone leading to the next and each innovation unlocking greater and gteater possibilities.

Fast foreard thousands if years, the transistor, a tiny, semiconductor device, was another such spark. It revolutionized electronics, paving the way for computers, smartphones, and the digital age. And with each new technological leap, the possibilities expanded, the horizons broadened. 

It's a chain reaction, a domino effect. One invention unlocks the potential for countless others. The more we know, the more we can create. The more we create, the more we learn. It's a cycle of discovery, a dance between ingenuity and necessity.

In his very insightful book, author & investot Mike Maples Jr tells the story of Justin TV (eventually Twitch) and... talk about inflection poin...

What's an inflection point and are we in one right now?

An inflection point, according to author & investor Mike Maples Jr is a point in time when an invention or tech is made and it opens new possibilities .

When GPS were made for smartphones, that opened up so many possibilities because you could communicate your location. That opened things up for ride-sharing. That opened things up for food delivery and for groceries. That even opened things up for exploring because you have better directions and limitless maps.

In my book, I describe how AI & blockchain will allow us to marry emotional currency and material currency. So now we gain socially AND material. But first We have to lock down AI & blockchain first but the possibilities is breathe-taking! Lmao

picture : unit of account - observed by SI. recorded on block chain . pic of ledger
picture : store of value - puc of hearts of men and goods & services made by humans or SI

inflection moment : SI

why this will work:
  the pieces are in place
  all requirements of currency met
  follows pattern Mike Mappes has observed

what will happen:
  GOAT World ! charlie sheen meme!
