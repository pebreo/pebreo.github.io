Inflection points unlock possibilities

The discover of fire was a flicker in the darkness which gave warmth from the cold night and helped satiate our desperatechunger for meat we now cook without fear of parasites or diseases. It was a spark, a beginning. From that initial invention, a cascade of innovations followedâ€”electric motors, power grids, appliances. Each new discovery, a stepping stone leading to the next.

The transistor, a tiny, semiconductor device, was another such spark. It revolutionized electronics, paving the way for computers, smartphones, and the digital age. And with each new technological leap, the possibilities expanded, the horizons broadened.
