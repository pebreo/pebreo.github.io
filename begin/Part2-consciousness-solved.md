# A mystery solved

## Darren
Darren jolted awake to the insistent chirping of his alarm clock.  It was the same melody, the same insistent rhythm, that had yanked him from his dreams for years.  He swung his legs over the edge of the bed, the familiar groan of the mattress a comforting constant.  

Autopilot engaged.  Coffee pot. Shower.  The bathroom mirror reflected a face Darren knew well.  Downstairs, the kitchen was a symphony of sizzling butter and the gurgling of the coffee maker.  Two slices of toasted everything bagel – a tried-and-true foundation.  A smear of plain cream cheese, a dollop of tangy strawberry jelly – a flavor combination that never failed to spark a smile.  Scrambled eggs, perfectly cooked, rounded out the plate.  Fuel for the day.

Stepping out the door, he inhaled the crisp morning air, the scent of autumn leaves mingling with the exhaust fumes of the city.  His route to work was a well-worn path.

Suddenly, a man in a lab coat, hair a wild halo of white, was gesticulating wildly, brandishing a device that looked like a cross between a toaster and a ray gun.  Intrigued, Darren veered off course.

"Hold on there, sonny!" the man barked, his voice a touch too loud.  "Lost your way, have you?"  Before Darren could stammer a reply, the strange device whirred to life, and a beam of light bathed him in a soft, tingling glow.  A strange calm washed over him, a sense of serenity that felt…unfamiliar.

"There you go," the man said, a manic grin splitting his face.  "Fresh start! No more mundane mornings, no more stale routines!"  The world shimmered around Darren, the edges of reality blurring.  The last thing he registered was the faint scent of burnt toast and the echo of the mad scientist's cackle before everything faded to black. 

## TLDR


### Consciouness defined

It seems like a fundamental question is not even answered yet when trying to engineer AGI : what is consciousness? i believe the confusion is because the fundamental questio  of what consviousness is not "locked down". 

In my view, Hawkins propose a definition that makes the most sense. Here's the gist:

* **Self Model:**  Another way of saying self-awareness. It's basically an internal representation of yourself, your actions, and your place in the world. In a mental simulation, you are yet another object.
* **Memory:** It is storage of the input i.e. people, places, things, experiences, symbols, etc
* **Senses:** The ability to perceive the world, whether it's through cameras, microphones, or lines of code, is essential for navigating and interacting with your environment.
* **Qualia:**  Qualia is the subjective experience of things – the redness of a rose, the tang of a lime. Much more to say & explore about this. 

Here's the beauty of this approach: we can focus on building these core functionalities doesnt automatically mean... down in the philosophical quagmire of consciousness. We can scale or throttle all these aspects of consciousness to my synnthetic consciousness. 

Imagine an AI with a phenomenal self-model, a bottomless memory bank, and an uncanny ability to perceive the world. 

## Why it's true


## Implications
- 
- We can build synthetic consciousness. To be decided though.
- We can throttle of scale each component of consciousness
