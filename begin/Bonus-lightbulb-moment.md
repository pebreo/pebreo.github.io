Our fear of the dark has ancient roots. Imagine our primate ancestors roaming the savannahs and surving the nights' predators with their overpowering strength, speed, and fangs. What did we have to survive but ourselves and our intelligence?

The dark is a beast. It creeps, it crawls, it promises monsters. It's the unknown, vast and hungry. You hear rustles, creaks, shadows dancing in the corners of your vision. Your mind, a fertile ground for fear, plants a garden of terrors.

Then, the click. A tiny burst of light, a defiant pinprick against the blackness. The flashlight beam is a sword, cutting through the darkness. The monsters retreat, revealed as mere shadows, illusions born of fear. The world, once a terrifying abyss, becomes a place to explore with vast new vistas to discover. The unknown, tamed. 

My hope in writing this book is to shed light on some fundamental mysteries and to help alleviate our fears so humanity can forge an incredibke new path!

## Lightbulb moment: SI can be our new electricity 

In the book, I explain that, LLMs are amazing. They're not perferct and I write sbout that in the book too. 

What I didnt a chance to write in the book is that SI can be our new electricity. 

So, what dont we understand?
Memory, cinsciousness, black-box mature of status quo AI.

I try to illuminkate (pun intended) all tjise things in my book...

can we design safety in our SI? yes. uk plug inage.

## AI: Our Modern-Day Electricity

Artificial intelligence, once a realm of science fiction, is now as commonplace as electricity. Like the initial shock of the first light switch, AI’s emergence sparked a mix of awe and apprehension. It was a force to be reckoned with, a double-edged sword capable of extraordinary benefits and catastrophic harm.

But as with electricity, fear has gradually given way to understanding and respect. We've learned to harness AI's power, to channel it into tools that augment our capabilities rather than replace them. From the mundane – optimizing traffic flow – to the monumental – aiding in medical research – AI has woven itself into the fabric of our society.

Yet, the analogy to electricity is not perfect. While we've developed robust safety protocols for electrical systems, AI remains a wild frontier. Its potential for misuse, for falling into the wrong hands, is a constant concern. It's a reminder that with great power comes great responsibility, a truth as relevant for AI as it was for the titans of industry who first harnessed electricity.

We stand at a crossroads. We can let AI spiral out of control, a Frankenstein's monster of our own creation. Or, we can approach it with caution and foresight, building a framework of regulations and ethics that ensures AI serves humanity rather than dominates it. The choice is ours, and the consequences will echo through generations.
 
Just as we learned to coexist with electricity, finding a balance between its power and our safety, we must now do the same with AI. It's a challenge, undoubtedly, but one that defines our era. The future depends on our ability to navigate this new frontier with wisdom and courage.
