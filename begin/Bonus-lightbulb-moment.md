The dark is a beast. It creeps, it crawls, it promises monsters. It's the unknown, vast and hungry. You hear rustles, creaks, shadows dancing in the corners of your vision. Your mind, a fertile ground for fear, plants a garden of terrors.

Then, the click. A tiny burst of light, a defiant pinprick against the blackness. The flashlight beam is a sword, cutting through the darkness. The monsters retreat, revealed as mere shadows, illusions born of fear. The world, once a terrifying abyss, becomes familiar ground. The unknown, tamed.
