The dark is a beast. It creeps, it crawls, it promises monsters. It's the unknown, vast and hungry. You hear rustles, creaks, shadows dancing in the corners of your vision. Your mind, a fertile ground for fear, plants a garden of terrors.

Then, the click. A tiny burst of light, a defiant pinprick against the blackness. The flashlight beam is a sword, cutting through the darkness. The monsters retreat, revealed as mere shadows, illusions born of fear. The world, once a terrifying abyss, becomes familiar ground. The unknown, tamed. 

My hope in writing this book is to shed light on some fundamental mysteries and to help alleviate our fears so humanity can forge an incredibke new path!
