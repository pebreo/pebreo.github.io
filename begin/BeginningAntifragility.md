todo: why antifragility works : overcompensation

why it works for love : vulnerabilty open up to rejection but can be very tewarding connections

why it works for entrepreneurship/biz:
failures (ideally small), helps you learn faster - iterate faster toward solution

## Roderigo
Roderigo's world shrunk faster than a line of code compiling. First, his mom. A quiet thief, cancer had stolen her laugh, then her memory, and finally, her life. Then, the world outside his window followed suit. A triple whammy: a loved-one's death, a global pandemic, a massive stroke. Stuck in a sterile room, the only companions were the monotonous beeps of machines and the nurses' awkward attempts at small talk. 

He, a programmer, had always been fascinated by the burgeoning field of AI. But here, with nothing but his own thoughts for company, the limitations became glaringly obvious. The nurses, bless their hearts, relied heavily on voice-activated radios. They worked sometimes but if they said anything to the machine other thsn Smith or Jones, it would ask them to repeat the request. Ethnic names like Wojchiehowski or Abagyani failed. Nurses job is already hard enough.  Frustration, a  bubbled up. AI, the supposed future, was supposed to make their job easier?  That night, staring at the flickering fluorescent lights, Roderigo had his first epiphany: current AI sucks. 

The forced isolation wasn't all bad. Time, once a luxury programmer life rarely afforded, stretched before him, a vast unexplored territory.  His body, betrayed by the stroke, became a constant reminder of another truth, a truth so obvious it was easy to overlook: health was the ultimate wealth. He vowed to change his lifestyle completely.

Also, as his physical therapy progressed, a new fascination took root. The therapists spoke of the brain's two halves â€“ the old, reptilian brain, content to keep him breathing and walking, and the neocortex, the shiny new toy responsible for that spark of imagination, the ability to problem solve, to dream.  Here was the key, he realized. AI works like the old brain. It needed an upgrade. 

The world outside his window was slowly regaining its vibrancy, but within Roderigo, a different kind of revolution was brewing. He wouldn't just write code anymore, he'd sculpt a future where AI could not only understand his name, but also the symphony of accents that colored the world.  His stroke had stolen his mobility, but had inadvertently gifted him a new vision, a path that stretched far beyond the confines of his hospital room.  He now had the ability to be able to understand consciouness and intelligence.
