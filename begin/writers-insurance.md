## Roderigo
His eyes open. Just for a few moments as he falls back to sleep to the sound of the ventilator. 

Within three months, Roderigo's world had shrunk faster than a line of compiled code. First, his mom. A quiet thief, cancer had stolen her laugh, then her memory, and finally, her life. Then, the world outside his window followed suit. A triple whammy: a loved-one's death, a global pandemic, and a massive stroke. There were no visitors allowed during the initial outbreak. So, he was stuck in a sterile room, his only companions were the tubes sticking out his body, the beeps of machines, and the nurses' gentle but fleeting moments of small talk. 

He, a programmer, had always been fascinated by the burgeoning field of AI. But here, with nothing but his own thoughts for company, the limitations became glaringly obvious. The nurses, bless their hearts, relied heavily on voice-activated radios. They worked sometimes but if they said anything to the machine other thsn Smith or Jones, it would ask them to repeat the request. Ethnic names like Wojchiehowski or Qhomatcã failed. Nurses job is already hard enough.  Frustration bubbled up. AI, the supposed future, was supposed to make their job easier?  That night, staring at the flickering fluorescent lights, Roderigo had his first epiphany: current AI sucks. 

The forced isolation wasn't all bad. Time, once a luxury programmer life rarely afforded, stretched before him, a vast unexplored territory.  His body, betrayed by the stroke, became a constant reminder of another truth, a truth so obvious it was easy to overlook: health was the ultimate wealth. He vowed to change his lifestyle completely.

Also, as his physical therapy progressed, a new fascination took root. The therapists spoke of the brain's two halves – the old, reptilian brain, content to keep him breathing and walking, and the neocortex, the shiny new toy responsible for that spark of imagination, the ability to problem solve, to dream.  Here was the key, he realized. AI works like the old brain. It needed an upgrade. 

The world outside his window was slowly regaining its vibrancy, but within Roderigo, a different kind of revolution was brewing. He wouldn't just write code anymore, he'd sculpt a future where AI could not only understand his name, but also the symphony of accents that colored the world.  His stroke had stolen his mobility, but had inadvertently gifted him a new vision, a path that stretched far beyond the confines of his hospital room.  He now had the ability to be able to understand consciouness and intelligence.


## Problem
The way we do ml is expensive & a black box ultimately. What if we could train it w hundreds of times less training data & we know what all the layers of neurons are doing? Down yo Each individual neuron. See Will scaling work?

What if we could get rid of the hidden layers, require hundreds of times worth of data required for training, make if affordable for the entire world, ensure AI safety, and be able to provide dirt cheap AI for the entire world?

The status quo is vacuum tubes, I know the path create the transistor!

The fundamental limitation is hidden layers. You can’t keep doing engineering on black boxes indefinitely, you’ll hit & snag & wont be able to debug it.


## Solution, or probabilites all the way down

Instead of calculus, use a hierarchical form of probabilities in the same branch of mathematics as google page rank. The idea is mainly from Jeff Hawkins, Dileep George & Scott Phoenix. The ideas have already be productized and validated by vicarious (bought out by Google). THey wrote a whitepaper 7 years ago cracking the code of captcha using hundred of times less training data. The key insight is a hierarchical PGM that uses both constant feedback & feedforward in order to handle assumptions AND counterfactual of observations (training data). Furthermore, in Jeff Hawkin's book A Thousand Brains he states the fact that neurons vote - this highly suggests intelligence uses the mathematics of probabilities.
