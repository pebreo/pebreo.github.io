## Dr. Chen
Dr. Chen squinted at the blinking cursor, the weight of the problem heavy on her shoulders. "Look," she said, leaning back in her chair, "we can't just hope AI magically gets it. We need to build foresight into these algorithms, a kind of imagination."

Her colleague, a young grad student named Patel, nodded eagerly. "Exactly! And that means understanding the nuances of human values, the messy, subjective stuff. We can't just shove numbers at it and expect it to spit out Gandhi."

"Right," Chen continued, tapping her pen against the desk. "Honesty, for example. How do we quantify that? We can build models to flag inconsistencies, sure, but what about intent? Can an AI truly understand the difference between a white lie and a malicious one?"

Patel chuckled. "And communication? We can analyze information flow, sentence structure, but that's just the technical. What about the unspoken parts, the cultural context, the emotional undercurrents?"

They both fell silent for a moment, the gravity of the challenge settling in. This wasn't just about building a smarter chess bot. This was about building a partner, one that could understand the complexities of human existence and navigate them with something approachingâ€¦ well, something approaching a conscience.

"But we have a massive advantage," Chen finally said, a spark of determination igniting in her eyes. "We have centuries of data on warfare. We know what not to do. We can train the AI on that, on the colossal human failure of conflict, and tell it, with every bit of information theory and probability we can muster: Do the opposite."

Patel grinned. "Now that's a training dataset with some range."

The problem was vast, the path uncertain, but for the first time, they felt a flicker of hope. Maybe, just maybe, they could nudge AI onto a path of understanding, not just of data, but of the messy, beautiful, deeply human world. 

## TLDR
AI alignment problem is a problem because humans can be harmed intentionally or unintentionally. To solve this we need AI that has foresight, honesty, and communicates with us. To create foresight we need to build imagination, and honestly and communication must be characteristic built with probability and information theory. We can give training data on warfare (its human history so much data on that) and tell it to do the opposite.
