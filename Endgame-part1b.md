Based on this tldr, write a short story using the vocabulary, tone, pacing, casualness, insightfulness fron the book "range" by David Epstein: 

Why is the notion of endless growth good or bad in a captiladtic system?
Can we have an economy based on all the good things from capitalism (innovation, job creation, taxes to fund public good) without the negatives (resource depletion, people being left behind, social unrest)? Is it possible? Yes, if you merge social currency with monetary currency. People would be incentivized to be artistic, creative, humorous, travel, meet people, invent new things, create more humans - just incentivize human connections & creativity. Afterall, the economy is not zero sum: put plainly, a bigger pie means more for everybody!

Maya, a fresh-faced intern at a bustling startup, furrowed her brow at the presentation slide. "Endless Growth? Sounds exhausting," she muttered to her neighbor, Ben, a programmer with a perpetual twinkle in his eye.

Ben chuckled. "Imagine the economy as a giant cookie jar," he said, launching into a metaphor. "Zero-sum games are like tug-of-war with cookies. You win one, I lose one. But the economy? It's a bakery! We can bake more cookies, way more, if we all get a little creative."

Intrigued, Maya leaned in. "So, innovation is like inventing new cookie recipes? And specialization? Like, I make the chocolate chip, you make the snickerdoodles?"

Ben grinned. "Exactly! We all bring something different to the table. And trading? That's swapping some snickerdoodles for a taste of your awesome chocolate chip."

Suddenly, the CEO boomed from the front, "Growth is the engine, folks! It fuels jobs, taxes, the whole shebang!"

Ben whispered, "But what if the engine's burning through the flour too fast? We need a sustainable recipe, right?"

Maya's eyes widened. "Maybe there's another ingredient. Like, a social currency? Imagine points for being artistic, funny, even just making new friends. We'd be incentivized to connect, create, be human!"

Ben's smile stretched ear to ear. "A bigger pie, Maya! With more flavors for everyone. Now that's an economy I can get behind."

Later, brainstorming with Ben, Maya sketched a vision: a world where innovation wasn't just about widgets, but about human connection. Maybe endless growth wasn't the answer. Maybe it was about a richer recipe, one that nourished the soul along with the wallet. The possibilities, like a pan overflowing with warm, gooey cookies, seemed endless after all.
