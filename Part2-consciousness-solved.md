### What is consciouness? 

It seems like a fundamental question is not even answered yet when trying to engineer AGI : what is consciousness? i believe the confusion is because the fundamental questio  of what consviousness is not "locked down". 

In my view, Hawkins propose a definition that makes the most sense. Here's the gist:

* **Self Model:**  Another way of saying self-awareness. It's basically an internal representation of yourself, your actions, and your place in the world. In a mental simulation, you are yet another object.
* 
* **Memory:** It is storage of the input i.e. people, places, things, experiences, symbols, etc
* **Senses:** The ability to perceive the world, whether it's through cameras, microphones, or lines of code, is essential for navigating and interacting with your environment.
* **Qualia:**  Qualia is the subjective experience of things â€“ the redness of a rose, the tang of a lime. Much more to say & explore about this. 

Here's the beauty of this approach: we can focus on building these core functionalities doesnt automatically mean... down in the philosophical quagmire of consciousness. We can scale or throttle all these aspects of consciousness to my synnthetic consciousness. 

Imagine an AI with a phenomenal self-model, a bottomless memory bank, and an uncanny ability to perceive the world.
