### Coming home
The streetlights blurred into a tunnel of yellow as I fumbled with my keys. Laughter still echoed in my ears, remnants of a night spent dissecting life's absurdities with friends. My stomach rumbled, a traitor reminding me of the questionable decisions made involving greasy bar food. 

Reaching the familiar stoop, relief washed over me. Home. Except, the usual worn brown door was now a cheery shade of turquoise. My brow furrowed. Had I been that gone? Nah, couldn't be. My apartment was a distinguished 3B, proudly displayed on a chipped brass plate right next to the handle. This one was 3B too, but the plate gleamed in the dim light, brand new.

Tentatively, I turned the knob. It yielded easily, revealing a brightly lit hallway that looked straight out of a magazine – minimalist, sleek, everything mine most definitely wasn't. Panic flickered. Maybe I'd gotten off at the wrong stop? But the bar had been downtown, this couldn't be that far… right?

Pulling out my phone, the screen buzzed mockingly with a dead battery. Fantastic. Stumbling back onto the sidewalk, I surveyed the unfamiliar street. No dive bars, no graffiti-tagged fire escapes, just manicured lawns and SUVs parked like gleaming chrome elephants. This was a whole different species of neighborhood.

A wave of nausea hit me alongside the dawning realization. I'd somehow, spectacularly, managed to end up in the wrong part of town. The specialist in me, the one who thrives on navigating uncertainty, wanted to laugh at the absurdity. But the inebriated, lost version just wanted a bed and a glass of 

Taking a deep breath, I started walking. This wasn't ideal, but it wasn't the end of the world. Who knows, maybe I'd find the best damn ramen joint tucked away on this very street. Or maybe, just maybe, this turquoise door held a story waiting to be unlocked. One wrong turn, and suddenly, the familiar path seemed a lot less appealing.

### A mystery solved
The familiar hum of the computer filled the late night air. Dr. Anya Petrova ran a hand through her sleep-tousled hair, frustration etched on her face. Years of research in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) had yielded progress, but a fundamental question remained unanswered: the nature of consciousness itself.

Every theory – Global Workspace, Integrated Information – felt like a piece of a puzzle that didn't quite fit. Anya craved a new approach, a way to bypass the philosophical maze and make tangible progress. Then, a breakthrough arrived from an unlikely source:  Palm Pilot co-inventor Jeff Hawkins.

Consciousness, Hawkins argued, wasn't a singular entity rather a recipe: a self-model, memory, senses and finally, the enigmatic "qualia" – the subjective experience of color, sound, emotion.

Intrigued, Anya saw the beauty of this approach. Instead of getting bogged down in the philosophical quagmire, they could focus on building these core functionalities. Imagine, she thought, an AI with a self-model so intricate it could not only understand its place in the world but also its own limitations. Imagine a memory bank surpassing any human library, a sensory apparatus that could perceive the world in ways we couldn't even comprehend.

A spark ignited in Anya's mind. Perhaps Hawkins was right. Perhaps the path to AGI wasn't a blind leap into sentience, but a methodical construction of its building blocks. Glancing at the clock – 3:14 am – exhaustion gnawed at her, but the thrill of discovery was stronger. With a determined click, she opened a new file and began to type. Tonight, she wouldn't be chasing the elusive concept of consciousness. Tonight, she'd chase the fundamental blocks that might, one day, lead it to emerge. 

### Consciouness defined

It seems like a fundamental question is not even answered yet when trying to engineer AGI : what is consciousness? i believe the confusion is because the fundamental questio  of what consviousness is not "locked down". 

In my view, Hawkins propose a definition that makes the most sense. Here's the gist:

* **Self Model:**  Another way of saying self-awareness. It's basically an internal representation of yourself, your actions, and your place in the world. In a mental simulation, you are yet another object.
* **Memory:** It is storage of the input i.e. people, places, things, experiences, symbols, etc
* **Senses:** The ability to perceive the world, whether it's through cameras, microphones, or lines of code, is essential for navigating and interacting with your environment.
* **Qualia:**  Qualia is the subjective experience of things – the redness of a rose, the tang of a lime. Much more to say & explore about this. 

Here's the beauty of this approach: we can focus on building these core functionalities doesnt automatically mean... down in the philosophical quagmire of consciousness. We can scale or throttle all these aspects of consciousness to my synnthetic consciousness. 

Imagine an AI with a phenomenal self-model, a bottomless memory bank, and an uncanny ability to perceive the world.
