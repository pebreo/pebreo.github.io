## the plan
This book describes an ambitious plan to upgrade humanity. Here it is in a nutshell.

Let's embrace the messiness of life with an **antifragile mindset**. We're not just built to endure, we can actually thrive on the unexpected.  Think of ...

But this transformation goes beyond just us. Love is due for a rethink too. Maybe traditional models don't quite fit everyone. Let's **destigmatize** exploring different relationship structures, like polyamory or ethical non-monogamy (ENM) ones. The core of relationship doesn't change: honesty, communication, and vulnerability. Its time upgrade our relationships.

Now, the real game-changer: **karma socioeconomics**. Imagine a system built on human-aligned AI and blockchain. The AI is transparent, explainable, and works for everyone, not just a privileged few. Blockchain keeps things secure, and everyone's on the same page. Sounds ambitious, but with the convergence of technology its within humanity's grasp.

The result? A world where hunger, poverty, and disease become relics of the past.  War? Let's hope it becomes a footnote in history.  **Infinite growth** becomes not just possible, but celebrated. Human connection thrives, and innovation explodes as everyone becomes a potential game-changer. This wouldn't just be a utopia, it would be a whole new era for humanity, one built on the power of diverse experiences and a willingness to explore the unknown. Now that's a future worth getting excited about.
