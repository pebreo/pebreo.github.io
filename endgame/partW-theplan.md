## The Plan
Instead of rushing to specialize, let's embrace an antifragile mindset by sampling diverse experiences. Just as world-class inventors and scientists often dabble in seemingly unrelated fields before their breakthroughs, we'd do well to cultivate range before committing to any singular path. An antifragile system gains from disorder - the more we expose ourselves to life's inherent volatility, the better equipped we'll be to thrive amidst the inevitable storms. Developing broad competencies across disciplines is key to antifragility. With that foundational range, we can confidently explore the kinds of bold ideas that catalyze seismic cultural shifts.
