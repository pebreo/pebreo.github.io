## The Plan
Are we poised to enter a new human era? Yes. Here's how we can get there.
 
Start with your mindset. An antifragile system gains from disorder - the more we expose ourselves to life's inherent volatility, the better equipped we'll be to thrive amidst the inevitable storms. It's not about eliminating the downsides, but about thriving from them.

Next, we destigmatize polyamory and ethical non-monogamy (ENM). At their core, these structures still demand honesty, communication, and vulnerability - the bedrock of healthy bonds. It means a lot of work on our mental health too. 

Another game-changer lies in karma socioeconomics, a convergence of human-aligned AI and blockchain tech. This transparent, explainable AI works for everyone, not just an elite few. And blockchain? It keeps the whole system locked down and on the same page for all.

If we can pull this off, just imagine: hunger, poverty, disease - mere relics. War itself could become a footnote in the vast library of human progress. Infinite growth wouldn't just be possible, it would be celebrated as the new normal.

Human connection would thrive as creativity, innovation, and diversity explodes from our species. This new world, built on diverse experiences, ideas, even inventions could herald a renaissance for humanity. It's an ambitious vision, no doubt, but on in which ALL humanity can live long and prosper!
