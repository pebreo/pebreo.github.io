## The Plan
Are we poised to enter a new human era? Yes. Here’s how we can get there.

The plan can be broken to three parts: life, love, and wealth.

For life, we start with how we think about the world we live in. Start with your mindset, particularly an antifragile mindset. An antifragile system gains from disorder - the more we expose ourselves to life’s inherent volatility, the better equipped we’ll be to thrive amidst the inevitable storms. It’s not about eliminating the downsides, but instead, thriving from them.

For love, we emphasize honest communication and destigmatize polyamory and ethical non-monogamy (ENM). Both those types of relationships are not for everybody.  At the core, any relationship (monogamous or otherwise) still requires honesty, communication, and vulnerability – the bedrock of healthy bonds. It means a lot of work on our mental health, too.

Lastly, for wealth, we upgrade to karma socioeconomics, a marriage of human-aligned AI and blockchain tech. This transparent, explainable AI works as a constant recordkeeper with blockchain as a record. It would keep thorough, impartial, and private records of account and creates a positive feedback loop both emotionally and economically.

If we can pull those off then hunger, poverty, and disease would be mere relics. War itself would become a painful, distant memory. Also, infinite growth wouldn’t just be possible; it would be celebrated as the new normal.

Human connection would thrive as creativity, innovation, and diversity explode from our species. This new world, built on diverse experiences, ideas, and even inventions, could herald a renaissance for humanity. It’s an ambitious vision, no doubt, but one in which ALL humanity can live long and prosper!
