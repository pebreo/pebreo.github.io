## Acknowledgments

This book wouldn't have blasted off without the fuel of some incredible people. Buckle up for a quick roll call:

* **My Crew:** To my family and friends who endured late-night ramblings, endless revisions, and enough coffee shop conversations to launch a rocket. Thanks for being my mission control, keeping me grounded when I floated off into technical jargon, and celebrating every milestone (big or small) like a successful launch. 

* **The Eagle Eyes:** My eagle-eyed editor deserves a medal for spotting typos in equations at 3 am and wrangling my enthusiasm into a coherent narrative. Your patience and expertise are out of this world. Thanks for making this book shine brighter.

* **The Illuminators:** To the brilliant researchers and space enthusiasts who shared their knowledge and stories. You ignited my fascination with the cosmos and fueled my desire to share this passion with others. You're the real rockstars.

* **The OG Space Nerds:** A shoutout to the authors, documentarians, and science communicators who paved the way. Your work opened my eyes to the wonders of space exploration and continues to inspire. 

* **The Launch Pad:** My publisher deserves a standing ovation for taking a chance on this project and guiding it through the intricate process of getting into your hands. Thanks for believing in the story and helping me share it with the world.
