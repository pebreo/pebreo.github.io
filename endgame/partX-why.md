## Sarah
The fashion industry is competive. Sarah knew this. She saw that different designers' visions competed for attention. But Sarah also believed that the true magic wasn't in snatching the spotlight from others, but in the collective act of creation. 

It was like baking a pizza, she often thought. Each individual slice might seem like a zero-sum game – one person's enjoyment comes at the expense of another's. But the beauty lay in the act of creation itself. By constantly tinkering, by experimenting with new ingredients and techniques, the bakers could expand the pizza, adding entirely new flavors and experiences that everyone could potentially enjoy.

The same held true for fashion. Sarah didn't see other designers as rivals vying for a limited number of customers. Instead, she saw them as fellow creators, each adding their own unique thread to the ever-evolving tapestry of style. Collaboration, she believed, was the key to unlocking the true potential of the fashion industry – a vast, ever-expanding canvas where everyone could bring their A-game and leave their mark.

So, while others might have fixated on the competitive aspects, Sarah thrived in the collaborative spirit. She saw the fashion world not as a battlefield, but as a vibrant marketplace of ideas, a constant churn of innovation that promised a bigger slice of the pie for everyone involved. It wasn't about who got the biggest slice; it was about baking a bigger, tastier pizza in the first place. 

## TLDR
The economy is not zero sum. You can grow the pie bigger so more people can eat. Similary, the more people the bigger the pie and the the more creativity & industry you can have too.



## Clara
The rhythmic hum of the life support machine was the only constant in the symphony of memories swirling in Clara's mind. Her breaths came in shallow gasps, each one a reminder of the approaching curtain call. Yet, amidst the physical decline, a curious sense of peace settled over her.

She lived a very humble life. Worn clothes and hand-me-downs were the norm, a testament to a life lived on the edge of financial security. But in the tapestry of her years, a different kind of richness shone through.

Her heart, once a frantic drum, now beat a gentle rhythm of cherished connections. The calloused hand resting in hers belonged to her husband, their love story a testament to enduring companionship, built not on grand gestures but on shared struggles and whispered dreams. The faces surrounding her bed, etched with love and worry, were her children and grandchildren, each a unique thread woven into the fabric of her life.


There were regrets, of course. Paths not taken, dreams left unfulfilled due to the relentless demands of putting food on the table. She'd made mistakes, oh yes, plenty of them. Bridges burned, harsh words spoken, the sting of decisions that still haunted her. But amidst the missteps, there was a relentless pursuit of life, a refusal to let fear or caution hold her back.

And her children, a rambunctious, messy bunch in mismatched clothes – a reflection of their upbringing – were a testament to that. Each one a unique storm, a whirlwind of personalities that had tested her patience and stretched her limits. Yet, looking at their faces, etched with love and a touch of the same wild spirit she possessed, a warmth filled her chest. They were her legacy, a testament to the messy, beautiful chaos of life lived with a shoestring budget and an overflowing heart.

As her breath hitched for the final time, a contented smile graced her lips. It wasn't the size of the bank account, but the richness of the life she lived, chasing experiences rather than possessions, that truly mattered. And that, she knew, was a wealth beyond measure. A life brimming with grit, laughter, and the unyielding love of a family she fiercely built, one struggle overcome and memory made at a time.

## TLDR

A rich social life means friends, family, loved ones, even experiences. Without basic needs met, you are miserable.

## Liza
Liza clutched the thin envelope, its contents a physical manifestation of the tightrope walk that was her life. Rent was due, and the number inside, scrawled in her landlord's impatient hand, felt more like a taunt than a figure. This wasn't new territory. The constant pressure of bills, the never-ending game of financial Tetris, was the rhythm of her life.

Tonight, though, the worry gnawed deeper. Her daughter, Isha, had a nagging cough, and Liza knew a trip to the clinic loomed. The clinic visit itself wasn't the worry, it was the potential prescription, the drugs Isha desperately needed but Maya might not be able to afford. This wasn't a binary choice; it was a tangled web of possibilities, each leading down a path fraught with its own brand of stress.

Exhaling a ragged breath, Liza forced herself to prioritize. Isha's health came first. Maybe she could call her cousin again, explain the situation, swallow her pride and ask for a loan. It was a gamble, but the alternative, the worry knot tightening in her gut, was a path she refused to walk.

Poverty, Liza thought, wasn't a single blow, but a relentless barrage of small decisions, each one chipping away at your sense of security. It wasn't about a lack of intelligence or drive; it was about navigating a system that seemed rigged against you at every turn. Yet, despite it all, a sliver of hope remained. She had faced these challenges before, and she had found a way. This time would be no different. Maybe.

## TLDR

Money is necessary for the basics: food, medicine, education. After a certin point, its utility is seen and used beyond survival.


## What is a rich life?

In one extreme, you have a rich social life: friends, family, loved ones and memorable, happy experiences. on the other extreme, you are worried if you will eat the next day or you can afford medicibe for your child. 

Poverty, in its most severe form, restricts this exchange, forcing individuals to prioritize basic survival needs over the experiences that truly enrich life. A rich life, popular belief goes, transcends mere financial abundance; it encompasses the ability to participate fully in the economic and social spheres, engaging in activities that contribute to personal growth and fulfillment. Do we have to chooose? Why not both?


## We so flywheel
Why does it matter that people have material things or rich social lives? It matters because it can lead to a virtuos cycle: more material goods, means more innovators which leads to more material goods. On and on. Its a positive feedback system.

To understand why, lets look at two important frameworks: Maslows Hiearchy of Needs and the VALS framework.

### Maslows Hiearchy
Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology that proposes a pyramid-shaped model of human motivation.  This model suggests that people are driven by five essential needs, starting at the base with the most fundamental for survival.

According to Maslow, as we fulfill each level of needs, we begin to focus on the needs at the next level.  The basic needs at the bottom of the pyramid are physiological needs, like food, water, and shelter. Once these basic needs are met, we start to crave safety and security, including things like financial stability and a safe environment.

The middle of the pyramid focuses on social and psychological needs. We seek love and belonging, wanting to feel connected to others through friendships, families, and romantic relationships. Esteem needs are also important here, where we desire feelings of accomplishment, self-respect, and recognition from others.

Finally, at the very top of the pyramid sits self-actualization. This is the need to reach our full potential and live a meaningful life that fulfills our unique talents and goals.

### VAL Framework

What is the VALS psychgrsphic framework? 
VALS (Values, Attitudes and Lifestyles) is a framework used to segment consumers based on their **psychological traits** and **motivations**.  

It categorizes people into groups based on what drives them, like principles, achievement, or self-expression. In business, it helps marketers understand what makes people tick and tailor products or messages to resonate with them and it can also be insightful for understanding people overall.

Heres a breakdown:

Thinkers: This segment within the Innovators group would be highly analytical and drawn to solving complex problems. They might be leading research efforts on sustainable energy or space exploration.

Makers: These Innovators would be driven by creating and building new things. They might be developing innovative technologies or artistic expressions.

Experiencers: This group would be motivated by seeking new experiences and pushing boundaries. They might be entrepreneurs launching groundbreaking ventures or explorers venturing into uncharted territories.

Now, imagine world where this exists: 

Motivated by principles and self-expression: They're driven by a desire to make a positive impact on the world and leave a lasting legacy. They're constantly seeking new challenges and pushing boundaries.

Highly educated and well-informed: They possess a deep understanding of complex issues and a thirst for knowledge.
Open to change and experience: They embrace new ideas and readily adapt to evolving circumstances.

Resource-rich: They have the financial security and freedom to pursue their passions and contribute to society.

The implications are staggering. When all the needs met we end up with a planet of innovators!

## Blending Social and Monetary Currency: A Richer Perspective
TODO: explain & rewrite below

Imagine a world where wealth wasn't just measured in dollars and cents, but also in the richness of experiences and connections. Money undoubtedly simplifies transactions, acting as a common language of value. But what about the value of that first laugh with your grandchild, or the satisfaction of conquering a challenging climb with friends? 

**Social wealth** It's about the social currency you accumulate – the quality time spent with loved ones, the shared experiences that forge deep bonds. They experieces and memories for people youvcare abliut and who care about you. These are deposits in your emotional bank account, yielding returns in the form of joy, love, and a sense of belonging.

**Financial wealth***
money plays a crucial role in securing our material and physical well-being. It allows us to acquire essential goods like food, clothes, and safe housing, ensuring basic survival. Money also grants access to healthcare, enabling us to pay for doctor visits, medications, and potentially life-saving surgeries. For example, having enough money can mean the difference between receiving critical cancer treatment or not. If youre lucky, you can use it buy entertainment, travel, property and all forms of material things. And for a rare few, satisfaction that you have more than others.


**Both can be true at the same time. Both achievable!**
Its commonly accepted that it's not just about the size of your paycheck, but the size of your heart, the strength of your connections, and the richness of the experiences you've accumulated. True wealth is a tapestry woven with both social and monetary threads, creating a life that is truly fulfilling. It wpuld take a quantum leap in thinking that humanity can BOTH have social and material wealth.


## Social and Monetary Currency 

Let's delve into the fundamental differences between social and monetary currency, using a first principles approach. 

**Monetary Currency: The Bedrock of Transactions**

Monetary currency excels at three key functions, forming the backbone of our current economic system:

1. **Unit of Exchange:** Imagine bartering a chicken for a pair of shoes. Impractical, right? Money acts as a standardized medium that eliminates the need for such direct exchanges. It simplifies transactions, allowing us to buy and sell goods and services with ease.

2. **System of Account:** Keeping track of every trade would be a logistical nightmare. Money facilitates record keeping. Every transaction leaves a clear trail, making accounting and economic analysis possible. 

3. **Store of Value:** Ideally, money retains its purchasing power over time. A dollar saved today should still buy something valuable tomorrow. This allows for saving, investment, and future planning – crucial aspects of financial security.

**AI & Blockchain: A quantum leap in money**

Blockchain technology, known for its secure record keeping, offers a potential solution:

* **A reliable recordkeeper:**
Imagine a benevolent AI dedicated to tracking and recognizing positive social interactions. This AI would function as a tireless and meticulous record keeper, documenting acts of kindness, volunteer work, community contributions, and other positive actions undertaken by individuals. This system would not only track the act itself, but also gather relevant details like the impact, beneficiaries, and context. This record could be accessed by individuals and potentially verified by others.


* **Tracking Interactions:** Imagine a secure, tamper-proof record of your "good deeds" or contributions to communities. Blockchain could create a verifiable history of social interactions, potentially increasing their perceived value.



## Why cant they be both?
| Characteristics of Money | Status Quo                                                    | Behavior/Karma                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Medium of Exchange       | Paper, metal, electronics bits                                | How you treat people & behave |
| Unit of Account          | Stored in government databases                                | Recorded by AI, stored in blockchain          |
| Store of Value           | Stored in metal, paper, real estate, factories, equipment etc | Store in "hearts of men"      |

Traditionally, money exists as physical objects like paper bills, coins, or digital representations in bank accounts. Governments and central banks control its value and act as the central record keepers. This status quo money allows us to buy and sell things, similar to a behavior/karma system where good deeds and positive interactions function as a medium of exchange. However, the key differences lie in its form and value determination. 

While traditional money is tangible, behavior/karma money is intangible. It's earned through ethical conduct and building trust within a community. Instead of government databases, using AI as recordkeeper using the electronic ledger that is the blockchain serves as the record for these interactions. While both systems aim to retain value over time, traditional money's worth fluctuates with economic conditions, whereas behavior/karma money is less susceptible but relies on the individual's continued positive actions. 


## TLDR
A convergence of technologies can help birth a new human era. It will be possible to achieve infinite growth in population and wealth. Marrying social and material gain using new money would make it possible by having the right incentives.
