## Clara
The rhythmic hum of the life support machine was the only constant in the symphony of memories swirling in Clara's mind. Her breaths came in shallow gasps, each one a reminder of the approaching curtain call. Yet, amidst the physical decline, a curious sense of peace settled over her.

She lived a very humble life. Worn clothes and hand-me-downs were the norm, a testament to a life lived on the edge of financial security. But in the tapestry of her years, a different kind of richness shone through.

Her heart, once a frantic drum, now beat a gentle rhythm of cherished connections. The calloused hand resting in hers belonged to her husband, their love story a testament to enduring companionship, built not on grand gestures but on shared struggles and whispered dreams. The faces surrounding her bed, etched with love and worry, were her children and grandchildren, each a unique thread woven into the fabric of her life.

She hadn't focused on accumulating possessions – the threat of eviction a constant companion. But on experiences that left indelible marks on her soul. The quiet joy of tending her community garden, the countless moments of shared laughter with friends over steaming mugs of borrowed tea – these were the treasures she carried within.

There were regrets, of course. Paths not taken, dreams left unfulfilled due to the relentless demands of putting food on the table. She'd made mistakes, oh yes, plenty of them. Bridges burned, harsh words spoken, the sting of decisions that still haunted her. But amidst the missteps, there was a relentless pursuit of life, a refusal to let fear or caution hold her back.

And her children, a rambunctious, messy bunch in mismatched clothes – a reflection of their upbringing – were a testament to that. Each one a unique storm, a whirlwind of personalities that had tested her patience and stretched her limits. Yet, looking at their faces, etched with love and a touch of the same wild spirit she possessed, a warmth filled her chest. They were her legacy, a testament to the messy, beautiful chaos of life lived with a shoestring budget and an overflowing heart.

As her breath hitched for the final time, a contented smile graced her lips. It wasn't the size of the bank account, but the richness of the life she lived, chasing experiences rather than possessions, that truly mattered. And that, she knew, was a wealth beyond measure. A life brimming with grit, laughter, and the unyielding love of a family she fiercely built, one struggle overcome and memory made at a time.

## Liza
Liza clutched the thin envelope, its contents a physical manifestation of the tightrope walk that was her life. Rent was due, and the number inside, scrawled in her landlord's impatient hand, felt more like a taunt than a figure. This wasn't new territory. The constant pressure of bills, the never-ending game of financial Tetris, was the rhythm of her life.

Tonight, though, the worry gnawed deeper. Her daughter, Isha, had a nagging cough, and Liza knew a trip to the clinic loomed. The clinic visit itself wasn't the worry, it was the potential prescription, the drugs Isha desperately needed but Maya might not be able to afford. This wasn't a binary choice; it was a tangled web of possibilities, each leading down a path fraught with its own brand of stress.

Exhaling a ragged breath, Liza forced herself to prioritize. Isha's health came first. Maybe she could call her cousin again, explain the situation, swallow her pride and ask for a loan. It was a gamble, but the alternative, the worry knot tightening in her gut, was a path she refused to walk.

Poverty, Liza thought, wasn't a single blow, but a relentless barrage of small decisions, each one chipping away at your sense of security. It wasn't about a lack of intelligence or drive; it was about navigating a system that seemed rigged against you at every turn. Yet, despite it all, a sliver of hope remained. She had faced these challenges before, and she had found a way. This time would be no different. Maybe.


## What is a rich life?

In one extreme, you have a rich social life: friends, family, loved ones and memorable, happy experiences. on the other extreme, you are worried if you will eat the next day or you can afford medicibe for your child. Do we have to choose? Can we have both?

Poverty, in its most severe form, restricts this exchange, forcing individuals to prioritize basic survival needs over the experiences that truly enrich life. A rich life, popular belief goes, transcends mere financial abundance; it encompasses the ability to participate fully in the economic and social spheres, engaging in activities that contribute to personal growth and fulfillment. Do we have to chooose?

## Blending Social and Monetary Currency: A Richer Perspective
TODO: add vals framework graphic and explain & rewrite below

Imagine a world where wealth wasn't just measured in dollars and cents, but also in the richness of experiences and connections. Money undoubtedly simplifies transactions, acting as a common language of value. But what about the value of that first laugh with your grandchild, or the satisfaction of conquering a challenging climb with friends? 

**True wealth transcends a bank statement.** It's about the social currency you accumulate – the quality time spent with loved ones, the shared experiences that forge deep bonds. These are deposits in your emotional bank account, yielding returns in the form of joy, love, and a sense of belonging.


**A truly rich life requires a balance between both currencies.** Money provides the security and freedom to dream beyond survival. It allows you to invest in experiences that deepen relationships, like that family vacation or a weekend getaway with friends. It empowers you to take risks and chase personal passions, whether it's mastering a new skill or volunteering for a cause you care about.

**Re-imagining broader definition of wealth empowers us to redefine success.** It's not just about the size of your paycheck, but the size of your heart, the strength of your connections, and the richness of the experiences you've accumulated. True wealth is a tapestry woven with both social and monetary threads, creating a life that is truly fulfilling. 


## Social and Monetary Currency 

Let's delve into the fundamental differences between social and monetary currency, using a first principles approach. 

**Monetary Currency: The Bedrock of Transactions**

Monetary currency excels at three key functions, forming the backbone of our economic system:

1. **Unit of Exchange:** Imagine bartering a chicken for a pair of shoes. Impractical, right? Money acts as a standardized medium that eliminates the need for such direct exchanges. It simplifies transactions, allowing us to buy and sell goods and services with ease.

2. **System of Account:** Keeping track of every trade would be a logistical nightmare. Money facilitates record keeping. Every transaction leaves a clear trail, making accounting and economic analysis possible. 

3. **Store of Value:** Ideally, money retains its purchasing power over time. A dollar saved today should still buy something valuable tomorrow. This allows for saving, investment, and future planning – crucial aspects of financial security.

**Social Currency: The Power of Connection**

Social currency, while impactful, doesn't fulfill all three functions:

1. **Limited Exchange:** Unlike money, "likes" on social media won't get you groceries. Social currency has limited use in directly acquiring goods and services. While it might offer discounts or exclusive access in certain situations, it lacks the universality of money.

2. **Subjective Valuation:** Quantifying social interactions is a challenge. How do you compare a retweet to a heartfelt recommendation? Is a million "followers" more valuable than a small circle of close friends? Social currency's worth is subjective and varies based on context.

3. **Fluctuating Value:** Unlike money, social currency can be fleeting. A viral trend today might be forgotten tomorrow.  The "worth" of social capital can depreciate rapidly, unlike the relative stability of most currencies.

**Blockchain: Can It Revolutionize Social Currency?**

Blockchain technology, known for its secure record keeping, offers a potential solution for some limitations of social currency:

* **Tracking Interactions:** Imagine a secure, tamper-proof record of your "good deeds" or contributions to communities. Blockchain could create a verifiable history of social interactions, potentially increasing their perceived value.

However, challenges remain:

* **Assigning Value:** Blockchain can't determine the inherent worth of a social interaction. Is a million "likes" more valuable than a single genuine act of kindness? Assigning objective value to subjective experiences remains an open question.

* **Emotional Connection:** The human element is crucial. A blockchain can't capture the warmth of a handwritten thank-you note or the trust built through a face-to-face conversation. Replicating the emotional connection behind social interactions is a challenge for any technology.

**The Hearts of Men: Where Social Currency Reigns Supreme**

Despite these limitations, social currency holds immense power:

* **Reputation, Influence, and Trust:** Being known for helpfulness, reliability, or creativity can open doors. Social capital fosters trust and influence, leading to opportunities beyond mere financial transactions.

* **Emotional Connection:** Social interactions have an intrinsic value that goes beyond quantifiable metrics. A genuine connection with another human being can bring joy, fulfillment, and a sense of belonging, aspects that money can't directly buy.

**Conclusion: A Symphony, Not a Solo**

Monetary and social currency play distinct roles in our lives. While they share some similarities in facilitating exchange and value storage, their fundamental differences prevent them from being directly interchangeable. Social currency thrives on trust, connection, and emotional impact, while monetary currency excels at facilitating transactions and storing value. Ultimately, a truly rich life requires a harmonious balance of both—a symphony of financial security and vibrant social connections.
