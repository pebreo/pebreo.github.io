Based on this tldr, write a story using the vocabulary, tone, pacing, casualness, insightfulness fron the book "range" by David Epstein: Why can't social currency and monetary currency one and the same? The three characr of money are: a unit if exchange, a system of account , and a store of value. Social interactions are a form of exchange, just as real as paper or coins changing hands. You can keep track (account) of those social exchanges on a blockchain. If you make electronic ledger is secure, then there little issue . Lastly, a store of value. You store value in both the "hearts of men " and in the electronic ledger (blockchain)

 
## Why Social and Monetary Currency Differ (First Principles Approach)

* **Monetary Currency:** Fulfills three key functions:
    * **Unit of Exchange:** Acts as a standardized medium for buying and selling goods/services. (Imagine directly bartering chickens for shoes - impractical!)
    * **System of Account:** Allows for easy record keeping and tracking of transactions. (Without it, remembering every trade becomes a nightmare!)
    * **Store of Value:** Retains purchasing power over time. (Money saved today should still buy something valuable tomorrow.)

* **Social Currency:** Doesn't fulfill all three functions:
    * **Unit of Exchange:** Limited use in direct exchange for goods/services. (You can't buy groceries with "likes" on social media.)
    * **System of Account:** Difficult to quantify and track social interactions. (How do you compare a retweet to a heartfelt recommendation?)
    * **Store of Value:** Social currency can fluctuate and lose "worth" over time. (A viral trend today might be forgotten tomorrow.)

* **Blockchain Technology:** 
    * **Potential for Social Currency:** Could offer a secure way to track and record social interactions. (Think of a tamper-proof record of your "good deeds.")
    * **Limitations:** Doesn't solve the challenges of assigning value and ensuring long-term worth to social interactions. (Is a million "likes" more valuable than a single, genuine act of kindness?)

* **"Hearts of Men":** 
    * **Social Currency's Strength:** Holds value in terms of reputation, influence, and trust. (Being known for helpfulness can open doors!)
    * **Challenge for Blockchain:** Difficult to quantify and replicate the emotional connection behind social interactions. (A blockchain can't capture the warmth of a handwritten thank-you note.)

**Conclusion:** While social interactions share some similarities with monetary transactions, their fundamental differences prevent them from being directly interchangeable as currencies.
