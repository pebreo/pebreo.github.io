# What would happen if it worked

## Victor
Toby bounced on the balls of his feet, his eyes wide with a question that had been bubbling all evening. Grandpa Victor, nestled in his worn armchair by the crackling fireplace, chuckled.

"Fire away, champ," he said, his voice raspy with age but warm with amusement.

"Grandpa," Toby began, "is it true that back in your day, everyone had to work all the time?"

Victor leaned back, a nostalgic smile playing on his lips. "Not all the time, no," he said. "But work was definitely a bigger part of life. We didnt have robots."

Toby and Topher, the robot assistant, both smiled at eachother.

"But why?" he persisted, "Couldn't everyone just, you know, relax?"

Victor's smile softened. "Life wasn't so simple then, Toby. People had jobs to pay rent, buy food…"  He paused, a shadow flickering across his eyes. "Food wasn't always guaranteed for everyone. For many people who grew their own food, there were times when crops failed and so maybe they couldnt eat. And you had to work to earn money to give in exchange for things."

Toby frowned. He always had a full plate at his disposal. Hunger seemed unimaginable.

"And what about the big, scary stuff?" he continued, his voice barely a whisper. "Climate change, and pollution, and stuff."

Elias sighed. "Those were worries too, Toby. The world wasn't as aware of it back then, but the signs were there. Floods, droughts, strange weather patterns. It wasn't like the news cycle you have now, bombarding you with constant information."

"So, it was harder back then?" Toby asked, his voice laced with a newfound empathy.

"Harder in some ways, definitely," Elias said, his gaze flickering to the crackling fire. "But life had its own pace, a simpler rhythm. People valued things differently – community, resourcefulness, the thrill of a good harvest. We weren't as connected, but in some ways, we were closer."

Toby pondered this for a moment, his brow furrowed in thought. "So, it wasn't all bad?"

Elias's smile returned, brighter this time. "Not at all, Toby. Every era has its challenges, but it also has its opportunities. The difference is how we choose to face them. Back then, we didn't have the technology you do, but we had grit, and a spirit of innovation. And that," he said, his voice firm, "is something that will never go out of style."

Toby nodded slowly, a thoughtful glint in his eyes. The future, with all its unknowns, seemed a little less daunting now. Perhaps the key wasn't just the fancy gadgets, but the human spirit that built them, the spirit that had faced challenges before and emerged stronger.  He looked back at his grandpa, a tiny spark of determination igniting within him. Maybe, just maybe, his generation could learn from the past and build a future that was both innovative and kind.



## Nimfa
The fluorescent lights of the coffee shop cast a hazy glow on Nimfa's phone screen. Unlike the usual barrage of likes and comments, a single message glowed: "Your influence is intriguing. Meet me at The Forge tonight, 12 AM." It wasn't a name, but a username - The Curator. A legend in the underground art scene, The Curator held the key to coveted gallery shows. Nimfa's stomach lurched. This was it.

But instead of dollars, Nimfa yearned for something more potent: karmacoin. Karmacoin wasn't a popularity contest. It was a verified record of genuine interactions, a digital handshake of respect and collaboration. Every time someone shared Nimfa's work or recommended her studio for its innovative workshops, her Karmacoin score ticked upwards. It wasn't about empty virality, it was about building a reputation as an artist with substance.

High Karmacoin unlocked doors beyond fame. Access to coveted artist retreats, and even collaborations with established names - all hinged on that verified score. It gamified social connection, prioritizing authenticity over manufactured popularity.

That night, Nimfa clutched her portfolio, a mix of nervous excitement bubbling in her chest. The Forge, a converted warehouse, buzzed with raw energy. It was a crucible for creativity, where reputations were earned through sweat and shared inspiration. Nimfa wasn't there to sell herself, but to share her vision - a series of mixed-media paintings that pulsated with the city's frantic energy.

A gruff voice interrupted her thoughts. "Nimfa Badiola? Impressive Karmacoin balance," rumbled The Curator, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "This isn't just art, it's a conversation. It embodies the core principle of Karma."

That night, Nimfa didn't just secure a gallery show. She sparked a conversation. People began to see Karmacoin as more than just a badge of honor, but a currency for fostering collaboration. The lines between financial success and social influence blurred, creating a new artistic landscape where value wasn't just about money, but the richness of human connection. From that moment on, Nimfa's art, and the movement she helped ignite, became a testament to the power of genuine exchange, proving that you could gain both in your wallet AND win  the hearts of your community.

## TLDR
Karmacoin would be the realization of merging behavior and money as we know it. An incentive to do what you love doing is icing on the cake. 



## Not a revolution or evolution: a quantum leap
Just imagine the creation of a super-intelligent AI capable of tackling humanity's most pressing challenges: climate change, poverty, disease. Exciting possibilities. Now include human-alignment, completely understandable and explainable, and affordable to all. I described how to do this in the first section.

Now consider Karmacoin, a system merging financial incentives with behavior. Imagine being rewarded financially for pursuing your passions, potentially leading to a more fulfilling work experience. Pro-social behavior, like volunteering, could be rewarded, promoting a more cooperative society.  This could fundamentally alter how we work and even the way our economy functions.

Both scenarios offer a glimpse of a future brimming with potential. Combined, the two would unleash the potential of all humanity - billions of hearts & minds!


**Hard to swallow**

The merging of social and monetary currency is like peanut butter and jelly: great individually but unimaginable separate once experienced. Here are some hard-to-accept, wonderful consequnces;

* **Reputation, Influence, and Trust:**
We know that helpfulness, reliability, or creativity can open doors. Merging social and monetary currency will create a positive feedback loop. Now, being helpful, reliable, or creative can boost your reputation, leading to trust, influence, and opportunities as well as financial gain.

* **Emotional Connection:** Another benefit of merging material and social money is an incentive for genuine emtional connections. Authentic, pro-social interactions offers something deeply embedded in us: connection, joy, fulfillment, and belonging that goes beyond points in a system.

* **Infinite growth**
In a system where pro-social behavior and financial gain are intertwined, helping others earns you credits that translate to real purchasing power. Also, it incentizes creation, rather than destruction; giving, rather than keeping, sparking a virtuous cycle.  Furthermore, a larger population means more producers, consumers, and innovators. There is no incentive to do anything that would break human connections nor any incentive to stop.p Almost difficult to accept. 

## TLDR
A new era in humanity is possible. The technology is coming. AI & blockchain would be key players. Imagine billions working together, their social currency boosting reputation, emotional connection, and even infinte economic and population growth.
