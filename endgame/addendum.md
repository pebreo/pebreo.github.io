* **Instantaneous Connection:**  The ability to instantly connect with anyone across the globe through telephones and video calls is extraordinary. We can share information, emotions, and experiences in real-time, bridging geographical and social barriers.
* **Global Network:** The internet is a vast network of interconnected devices, allowing us to access information, communicate with anyone, and share ideas on a global scale. This interconnectedness has revolutionized communication and information dissemination.

**Medicine:**
* **Crazy idea because:**
Inject people with a weaker version of a virus? No. That will only get them sick.
* **Conquering Disease:** Vaccines have eradicated or significantly reduced the impact of once-devastating diseases like smallpox and polio. Antibiotics have drastically improved our ability to fight bacterial infections, saving countless lives and improving overall health.
* **Extended Lifespans:** Medical advancements have led to a significant increase in life expectancy. We can now treat and manage conditions that were once fatal, leading to longer and healthier lives.

**Other Technologies:**

* **Computational Power:**   ***Naysayers:These giant calculating contraptions cost a fortune! We can do sums just fine with pen and paper."*** The miniaturization of computers from room-sized machines to powerful devices we carry in our pockets is a testament to technological progress. This computational power allows us to solve complex problems, analyze data, and perform tasks that were once unimaginable.
* **Electricity:**  ***Naysayers:
Invisible power coursing through wires? Sounds like witchcraft! Fire and muscle power are the only reliable ways to do work.***
Harnessing electricity has transformed our world. It powers our homes, industries, and transportation, enabling a vast array of technologies and conveniences that were previously impossible.
* **Refrigeration:**  ***Naysayers:Wasting precious ice to make a fancy food locker? Seems like a frivolous use of a valuable resource.***
Refrigeration allows us to store food for extended periods, reducing spoilage and ensuring access to healthy food year-round. This has dramatically improved food security and global access to a variety of food sources.

## In-progress : blockchain
Blockchain technology is a combination of an electronic ledger, peer-to-peer file netorking, cryptography, and several other technologies. Heres more ibformstion:

**Decentralized Trust:**  Blockchain removes the need for a central authority to verify transactions and record data. This creates a system of trust and transparency, where everyone on the network can verify the accuracy and authenticity of information. This has the potential to revolutionize various industries by:

* **Eliminating Fraud:**  Blockchain's immutability makes it nearly impossible to alter data once it's recorded, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.
* **Empowering Individuals:**  By removing the need for centralized control, blockchain empowers individuals to have more control over their data and participate in secure transactions directly.

**New Applications:**  Blockchain's potential extends far beyond cryptocurrencies. Here are some examples:

* **Supply Chain Management:** Blockchain can track the movement of goods throughout the supply chain, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of counterfeiting.
* **Voting Systems:** Blockchain can create secure and transparent voting systems, reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.
* **Identity Management:** Blockchain can be used to create secure and tamper-proof digital identities, simplifying access to services and reducing identity theft.

**Innovation Potential:**  Blockchain is still in its early stages of development, and its potential applications are constantly evolving. It has the potential to disrupt various industries and create entirely new ones, making it a truly extraordinary technological innovation.

## In-progress: AI
Human-aligned, explainable, and affordable AI deserves a place alongside the other extraordinary inventions and is made possible using probabilites instead of calculus. Heres more information:

**Human-Aligned AI:**

* **Shared Values:** This type of AI prioritizes human well-being and aligns its decisions with human values like fairness, safety, and justice. It strives to benefit humanity and avoid causing harm.
* **Transparency and Trust:** Human-aligned AI operates in a way that humans can understand and trust. It provides explanations for its actions and decisions, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and AI.

**Explainable AI (XAI):**

* **Understanding the "Why":** XAI allows us to understand the reasoning behind an AI's decisions. This transparency is crucial for building trust, identifying and correcting biases, and ensuring responsible AI development.
* **Improved Decision Making:** By understanding the reasoning behind AI outputs, humans can better evaluate their accuracy and make informed decisions based on them.

**Affordable AI:**

* **Democratization of Technology:** Making AI affordable allows for its wider adoption and application across various sectors, including those with limited resources. This fosters innovation and creates opportunities for everyone to benefit from AI advancements.

* **Empowering Individuals:** Affordable AI tools can empower individuals with disabilities, provide access to information and services, and bridge the digital divide.

Achieving human-aligned, explainable, and affordable AI remains a significant challenge, but ongoing research and development are paving the way for a future where AI truly benefits humanity.

## In-progress : polyamory

**Romantic relationships involving more than 2 people**

While not an invention in the traditional sense, a healthy, genuine, and honest open relationship involving more than two people definitely qualifies as a "crazy" concept compared to the traditional societal norm of monogamy. 

**Enhanced Communication and Conflict Resolution:** 
Navigating an open relationship requires a high level of communication, honesty, and emotional intelligence. This constant practice can lead to stronger communication skills and conflict resolution abilities that benefit all relationships within the network, fostering deeper understanding and connection.

**Stronger Support Network:** 
Open relationships can lead to the creation of a larger, interconnected support network. Partners' additional relationships can become a source of friendship, guidance, and emotional support for everyone involved. This expanded network can be especially valuable during difficult times or when facing life challenges.

**Greater Sexual and Emotional Fulfillment** Open relationships can potentially allow individuals to fulfill diverse sexual and emotional needs that might not be fully met within a single partner. This can lead to increased sexual satisfaction, emotional intimacy, and a broader spectrum of experiences within relationships.

**Challenging the Monogamous Norm:**  
For recent human history, monogamy has been the dominant relationship model, ingrained in social structures and expectations. Polyamory/open relationships/ethical non-monogamy, especially those involving more than two individuals, challenge this deeply rooted concept, pushing the boundaries of what a "normal" relationship can look like.

While not for everyone, the ability to build genuine connections and navigate such complex dynamics with honesty and respect can be considered a revolutionary approach to love and intimacy. 

## Goodbye for now
These are just a few examples that highlight the extraordinary nature of these inventions and insights. They have fundamentally changed our lives, expanded our possibilities, and continue to shape the world we live in.
