## Maria
Maria scrolled through the endless stream of news articles, a familiar knot of frustration tightening in her stomach. The headlines screamed about rising inequality, the widening gap between the haves and have-nots. It was a narrative that painted the economy as a zero-sum game, a battlefield where one person's gain meant another's loss. It was a perspective that missed the forest for the trees.


Maria, a former waitress with a passion for fashion, had taken a leap of faith and founded her own clothing startup. Her designs, a fusion of vintage aesthetics and eco-friendly materials, resonated with a growing segment of the market. Her success wasn't a case of taking someone else's market share. It was a testament to the ever-expanding pie of the economy, where new ideas and diverse perspectives created new opportunities.

Sure, there were challenges. The fashion industry was notoriously competitive, with established brands wielding immense power. But Maria saw the bigger picture. The rise of e-commerce platforms, the growing awareness of sustainable practices, the increasing demand for ethical products â€“ these were all creating new avenues for innovative startups to emerge, challenging the status quo and expanding the consumer base.

It wasn't a perfect system. Access to capital and resources remained uneven, and the zero-sum narrative still held sway in many minds. But Maria refused to subscribe to that limited view. The economy, she knew, was a vast, interconnected web, where the success of one entrepreneur could inspire others, create new jobs, and stimulate growth across the ecosystem. She knew the pie could grow and she was doing her part in growing it.
